# Ten Lessons

Welcome to the Ten Lessons, which make up one half of our Business Ethics course. These lessons cover key topics in ethical considerations within the business realm. Throughout the course, we'll explore various ethical frameworks, influential moral philosophers, the importance of fact-checking in the news and on social media, corporate social responsibility, the triple bottom line, the necessity for having an ability to change our minds, and both the positive and negative aspects of corporate behavior. We'll also discuss the roles of power and privilege in business for promoting positive outcomes. My goal is to create a learning community in which we can consider ways to cultivate our character and to be able to make more principled decisions in the complex world of business. 

The goal of having these lessons is to engage you in learning more about ethics in the context of organizations.

Rules or guidelines that determine what is right and wrong for individuals. Codes of conduct within certain professions, such as accountants, journalists, or event planners help guide people toward more ethical decisions. 

## 01. It's all personal (or is it?)

![Course header graphic](https://innovatelearning.s3.amazonaws.com/busn435-course-header-lesson-01.jpg)

What does it mean to be ethical, especially in business? It's more than just knowing right from wrong; it's about understanding how our decisions impact others. 

In Zootopia, Judy Hopps (a rabbit police officer) is trying to solve a missing mammals case. During a press conference, she makes an unintentionally insensitive comment about predators. Nick Wilde, a fox and her unlikely partner, takes offense and confronts her about it.

!?[zootopia press conference scene](https://youtu.be/_abhnQkHOPU?si=e_0d7b1qjTYr6CKL)

This scene demonstrates how misunderstandings can arise, even with good intentions, and offers a valuable lesson about addressing such situations. While this story is fictional, these kinds of misunderstandings and opportunities for our biases to negatively impact us our relationships happen all the time in a business context. 

Avoiding taking things personally in a business or class context is essential for maintaining healthy relationships and effective communication. Here are a few ways we can work to accomplish that together and to create the kind of community that will foster the highest trust and deepest learning opportunities. 

### 01.01 | Develop emotional intelligence

Throughout this class we are going to be working on developing and cultivating emotional intelligence. Strengthen your emotional intelligence by understanding and managing your own emotions. Recognize that not everything is a personal attack or criticism. Practice empathy and try to understand the motivations and emotions of others in the situation. This allows you to respond thoughtfully rather than react emotionally.

In this short Inside Out movie clip, the character of Joy realizes the value of sadness. It is vital for us to be able to recognize our emotions and to attempt to understand and empathize with others' feelings. 

!?[Clip: Joy realizes the value of sadness](https://youtu.be/V9OWEEuviHE?si=gPCW1ha4JD_bIkPg)

Historically-marginalized populations often face emotional challenges related to discrimination, bias, and inequality. Developing emotional intelligence can help individuals from these communities navigate these challenges, build resilience, and advocate for their rights effectively. In researching grit and perseverance, Dr. Angela Duckworth, a renowned psychologist, emphasizes the significance of emotional intelligence. Her work underscores how understanding and managing emotions can empower individuals, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds, to overcome challenges and achieve success. 

James Baldwin, a prominent African American writer and activist, stressed the importance of empathy (which is a big part of emotional intelligence) in addressing racial inequalities. He argued that recognizing and empathizing with the experiences of marginalized communities is essential for fostering social change and dismantling systemic discrimination. 

> "Love takes off the masks that we fear we cannot live without and know we cannot live within."
>
> -- James Baldwin

In order to explore the topics in this class, recognizing the varying perspectives we will inevitably have and the unique cultures and backgrounds we each come from, emotional intelligence is going to be crucial. 

### 01.02 | Clarify and Seek Understanding

When faced with a potentially offensive or unclear statement, don't immediately assume negative intent. Instead, ask for clarification or seek to understand the speaker's perspective. This proactive approach can prevent misunderstandings and build trust by demonstrating your willingness to engage in open and honest communication.

In the following [movie clip from "The Princess Bride,"](https://youtu.be/D9MS2y2YU_o?si=ck4i3B00Gr7f_M9C) Vizzini, a character known for his intelligence, repeatedly uses the word "inconceivable" to describe unexpected events or situations. However, as the events become increasingly unusual, Inigo Montoya, one of his companions, becomes frustrated and points out, "You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means."

![The Princess Bride - Inconceivable](https://youtu.be/D9MS2y2YU_o?si=ck4i3B00Gr7f_M9C)

Watching this exchange serves to reminder us all that effective communication requires not only speaking clearly but also seeking understanding and ensuring that the words used convey the intended meaning. It illustrates how misunderstandings can arise when individuals do not clarify or seek to understand the language and expressions used in communication.

Paulo Freire, a Brazilian educator, highlights the importance of dialogue in his work on critical pedagogy. He argues that genuine understanding and transformation can only occur through dialogue that respects diverse perspectives and challenges oppressive systems. He also stresses the role that love plays in people being able to achieve this kind of mutual understanding.

> "Dialogue cannot exist in the absence of a profound love for the world and for people. The naming of the world, which is an act of creation and re-creation, is not possible if it is not infused with love. Love is at the same time the foundation of dialogue and dialogue itself."
>
> -- Paulo Freire

In these words, Freire underscores that meaningful dialogue and understanding require a deep love for the world and people. He suggests that through dialogue, we not only seek understanding but also engage in an act of creating and recreating our shared reality. Historically-marginalized communities often face misunderstandings and misrepresentations. Clarifying and seeking understanding is crucial to address these issues, promote cultural sensitivity, and dismantle stereotypes and biases.



### 01.03 | Separate feedback from identity

Learn to separate feedback or criticism from your self-worth. Constructive feedback is often about the task or the situation at hand and not a judgment of your character. Remember that feedback is an opportunity for growth and improvement, not a personal attack.

In "The Office," Jim gets a formal warning about how much time he spends goofing around. When in fact, the people giving him the feedback tend to be unable to process their feelings toward Jim or communicate with him in an otherwise healthy way. 

!?[Jim gets a formal warning](https://youtu.be/orm0sLYXSzw?si=FM9BNdMNttjW7niK)

This scene serves as a reminder that feedback should be constructive, objective, and focused on job-related performance. When feedback becomes intertwined with personal comments, it can hinder professional growth and create discomfort in the workplace. Those individuals who are from historically-marginalized populations may often receive feedback tied to stereotypes or biases. When we can separate feedback from our identity, it can empower us to assert our authentic selves and challenge oppressive narratives.

### 01.04 | Navigate cognitive dissonance

In order to develop emotional intelligence, it's crucial to be aware of cognitive dissonance, a psychological phenomenon where individuals experience discomfort due to conflicting beliefs or values. Cognitive dissonanceoccurs when we experience a sort-of mental tug-of-war that leaves us feeling uneasy and seeking resolution. But how do we deal with this internal conflict? There are some common ways that the human mind attempts to find equilibrium within ourselves.

Watch [this explainer from Concepts Unwrapped about Cognitive Dissonance](https://youtu.be/m_lCO2cBNts?si=FOTnpfcSHLs0iTTE) (6 minutes). 

!?[Cognitive Dissonance | Concepts Unwrapped](https://youtu.be/m_lCO2cBNts?si=B75B1GhqPAVAbp7G)

Edward Said, a Palestinian-American scholar, examined cognitive dissonance in the and argued that recognizing and addressing dissonance is crucial for promoting cross-cultural understanding and justice. Said emphasizes with the following quote the significance of recognizing and addressing the conflicts and dissonances that can arise when people from different cultures and backgrounds interact. 

> "The conflicts, tensions, and incompatibilities between cultures and societies generate the stuff of history and politics. Understanding and acknowledging these dissonances, rather than smoothing them over, is an important step toward genuine cross-cultural awareness."
>
> -- Edward Said

Said advocates for understanding these tensions as an essential aspect of human relationships, rather than attempting to erase or ignore them. In the film "A Beautiful Mind," the character John Nash, a brilliant mathematician, experiences cognitive dissonance as he struggles with his mental health issues. The movie highlights the importance of recognizing and addressing cognitive dissonance, as it can impact our emotional well-being and decision-making. It's a great movie, in case you haven't seen it before. Here's a [clip where Nash explains that he is different than other people](https://youtu.be/dCULi2k1su4?si=3PWv-chFXhoW9f-N). 

!?[Clip: A beautiful mind - I don't like people much](https://youtu.be/dCULi2k1su4?si=3PWv-chFXhoW9f-N)

Historically-marginalized groups can grapple with cognitive dissonance when faced with societal expectations that conflict with their authentic identities. Acknowledging and addressing these conflicts is essential for self-empowerment and cultural affirmation.

Developing emotional intelligence involves acknowledging and resolving these inner conflicts to make more informed and balanced choices. By implementing these strategies, individuals can minimize the tendency to take things personally, promote healthy communication, and build trust within a business context (as well as in our class' learning community).

## 02. That seems really inappropriate (Get to know your favorite philosophers) 

![Course header graphic - lesson 02](https://innovatelearning.s3.amazonaws.com/busn435-course-header-lesson-02.jpg)

Before we get to study applied business ethics (in the context of an organization or industry), it is important to establish a firm foundation. Let's first delve into the ideas and philosophies of influential thinkers who have shaped ethical thought over centuries. 

> What are the fundamental principles that guide ethical decision-making in business? How do different philosophical perspectives offer unique insights into corporate responsibility, sustainability, and social justice? 

By getting to know these philosophers (and some associated ethical frameworks), we will gain a deeper understanding of the ethical complexities that arise in the business world and how to navigate them effectively. The good news is that we aren't going alone.

### 02.01 | Road trip: We're going to Harvard

![LEGO depiction of a road trip to Harvard University - a group of students about to hop in a VW bus](https://innovatelearning.s3.amazonaws.com/busn435-lego-bricks-01-roadtrip.png)

Buckle up, as we are about to embark on a virtual road trip to the intellectual haven that is Harvard University! Now, don't get too excited, we won't be donning crimson robes and walking the hallowed grounds, but we will getting to make a visit to see the brilliant [Michael Sandel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Sandel) and his thought-provoking Justice course, which has been taken by more than 15,000 students[^1].

During our virtual visit, we'll also be meeting some of the biggest names in philosophy, like [Immanuel Kant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant), [John Stuart Mill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stuart_Mill), and [John Rawls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rawls). These philosophers have left their intellectual mark all over the study of ethics, and we'll be exploring how they guide our moral compasses in the complex world of business.

We are going to be looking at the intriguing "Moral Side of Murder" lecture from Sandel's course. This isn't a murder mystery, but a journey into the ethical intricacies that make us question our deepest beliefs. It's a wild ride that will challenge our moral intuitions and spark lively debates.

As we travel (at least in our imaginations) to Harvard's campus and experience Sandel's excellent teaching style, which is modeled off of Socrates (another philosopher we'll be meeting), let's remember the following timeless wisdom from that very same philosopher: 

> "An unexamined life is not worth living."
>
> -- Socrates

 Our trip to Harvard will guide us on a voyage of self-discovery, where we'll uncover the right path to ethical decision-making in the business world. 

[^1]: According to [an oped (opinion piece) by Thomas L. Friedman](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/15/opinion/15friedman.html) in the New York Times. 

### 02.02 | The moral side of murder and the case for cannibalism

Episode One of Sandel's Justice class considers how effectively utilitarianism helps us use utility for decision making and inquires as to whether it helps us arrive at the right answer. In the first half of his lecture, Michael Sandel presents a hypothetical scenario to his students: Would you kill one person to save the lives of five others? Is it the right thing to do? This scenario launches a discussion on moral reasoning and the complexity of making ethical decisions in extreme situations.

> If you had to choose between (1) killing one person to save the lives of five others and (2) doing nothing even though you knew that five people would die right before your eyes if you did nothing—what would you do?  What would be the right thing to do?

In the second half of this thought-provoking video, Michael Sandel delves into the ethical principles of renowned utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Bentham. He introduces a well-known nineteenth-century legal case that unfolds as a shipwrecked crew of four individuals faces an agonizing dilemma. After enduring nineteen days adrift at sea, the captain makes a morally complex decision – to sacrifice the life of the weakest member, a young cabin boy, to ensure the survival of the rest by consuming his blood and body. 

> Suppose you find yourself in a situation in which killing an innocent person is the only way to prevent many innocent people from dying. What’s the right thing to do? This question arose in The Queen v. Dudley and Stephens (1884), a famous English law case involving four men stranded in a lifeboat without food or water. How should we judge the action of Dudley and Stephens? Was it morally justified or morally wrong?

This captivating case serves as a catalyst for an engaging classroom debate, challenging the moral validity of utilitarianism and its doctrine that deems "the greatest good for the greatest number" as the ultimate ethical guideline. Join us as we explore this profound moral inquiry and grapple with the complexities of ethical decision-making.

###### ? 02.03 | Review questions | The moral side of murder

Test your understanding of the basics of the concepts Sandel brought up in this first lecture in his Justice series. It's better if you don't look up the answers on the internet, as this is supposed to challenge your brain (not your searching skills). If you get any question wrong, you can try, again, so do yourself (and your memory) a favor and allow the retrieval practice a chance to work. 

What is the main ethical dilemma in the trolley problem?

[[ ]] Choosing between two equally beneficial outcomes.
[[ ]] Deciding whether to intervene in a natural disaster.
[[ ]] Determining the best way to operate a trolley.
[[x]] Choosing between a direct action that saves more lives at the cost of fewer or inaction that results in more deaths.

In utilitarianism, what is considered the most ethical action?

[[ ]] The action that benefits the most powerful individuals.
[[ ]] The action that aligns with traditional moral values.
[[x]] The action that produces the greatest good for the greatest number.
[[ ]] The action that is easiest to perform.

How does the trolley problem challenge utilitarian principles?

[[ ]] It questions the value of individual rights.
[[ ]] It creates a scenario where no one is truly happy.
[[ ]] It presents a situation where all choices lead to a bad outcome.
[[x]] It forces a choice between the greater good and individual morality.

Which philosopher is most closely associated with the development of utilitarianism?

[[ ]] Immanuel Kant.
[[x]] John Stuart Mill.
[[ ]] Friedrich Nietzsche.
[[ ]] Socrates.

In the trolley problem, if you choose to divert the trolley to save five people but kill one, you are primarily applying which ethical principle?

[[ ]] Deontological ethics.
[[ ]] Virtue ethics.
[[x]] Utilitarian ethics.
[[ ]] Existential ethics.

### 02.04 Let's give them something to talk about

Discuss Justice - Part 1

The following discussion questions are adapted from Michael Sandel's materials. Answer the three questions posed below, as a means of reflecting further on the first Justice video. Refrain from looking up answers on the internet, as I want to discover what you think is the right thing to do here, not be influenced by what others think, or have thought in the past... 

Each question should prompt answers from you that are at least 4-5 sentences. You may alternatively record a video for each of the questions (please do the answers on separate videos, should you choose this route). Paste the link to each video in your reply. 

------

Let’s start with utilitarianism. According to the principle of utility, we should always do whatever will produce the greatest amount of happiness and whatever is necessary to prevent the greatest amount of unhappiness. But is that right? Should you always try to maximize happiness? Should you always do whatever is necessary to minimize unhappiness?

------

1. There are times when the only way to prevent harm to a large number of people is to harm a smaller number of people. Is it always permissible to harm a smaller number in order to prevent harm to a large number? 
2. Suppose you are driving through a narrow tunnel and a worker falls onto the road in front of you. There is not enough time for you to stop. If you keep straight, you will hit the worker and kill him, but if you swerve left into oncoming traffic, you will collide with a school bus and kill at least five children. What’s the right thing to do? Does utilitarianism have the right answer? 
3. Ten thousand innocent civilians live next to a munitions factory in a country at war. If you bomb the factory, all of them will die. If you don’t bomb the factory, it will be used to produce bombs that will be dropped on fifty thousand innocent civilians in another country. What’s the right thing to do?

Let's just say the topic of inappropriate things comes up in our household often. Let's also say that it isn't always because of something our kids have said in conversation. If pulling levers in the last Michael Sandel Justice video wasn't bad enough, now we are going to explore the case for cannibalism. 

In The Case for Cannibalism, Michael Sandel explores the ethical principles introduced by utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Bentham. Sandel delves into a compelling historical case from the nineteenth century, centered around a shipwrecked crew of four individuals. Faced with the dire challenge of survival after nineteen days adrift at sea, the captain is forced to make a morally complex decision – to sacrifice the life of the weakest member, the cabin boy, in order to sustain the rest of the crew by consuming his blood and body.

[[ ]] True

[[X]] False



Kant believed that it was ok to treat a human being a means to an end if it meant that the common good could be maximized.

[[ ]] True

[[X]] False



Which of the following moral frameworks did Kant subscribe to?

[[ ]] Utilitarianism

Virtue ethics - philosophy created by Aristotle and other ancient philosophers. It focuses on how to live a life of moral character. 

## 03. Decide how we decide when we decide

![Course lesson graphic 01](https://innovatelearning.s3.amazonaws.com/busn435-course-header-lesson-03.jpg)

When I was earning my doctorate, one of our professors would regularly emphasize the importance of deciding how we were going to decide something as a group, before we actually made any specific decision. As easy as that may sound, we weren't always very disciplined about doing it and conflict or group confusion would arise, because of us not having determined our process, in advance. 

> We are going to be going through a case study that will help you think about how you might make a decision, in the case where it wasn't obvious what the right thing to do was. Again, it is easier than it seems. Use the links on Canvas to access the case and follow the directions for working in groups for the second half. 

You are going to want to stop reading at this point and head over to Canvas, as otherwise the "ending" may be spoiled for the case and it won't be as meaningful or fun. 

### 03.01 | Ethical frameworks

Let's start with why everyone hates moral philosophy professors, or otherwise getting us to laugh a bit to warm up our brains to discover more about ethical frameworks. In this clip, The Good Place Channel does a mashup of two tv shows, both of which focus on philosophy: 

!?[Philosophy according to Jack and Chidi - The Good Place and AP Bio's mashup]((https://youtu.be/EQpkNxP7BxI?si=_GCs_XRryamqO-TV))

Ethical frameworks are systems of moral principles or guidelines that help individuals and organizations make ethical decisions and evaluate the moral implications of their actions. These frameworks provide a structured approach to navigating complex ethical dilemmas by offering a set of principles, rules, or perspectives to consider when facing moral choices.

You explored some of the ethical frameworks, as you were going through the case study. Several ethical frameworks exist, each with its own principles and approaches to ethical decision making. Let's explore some examples of ethical frameworks

#### Consequentialism: Weighing actions by their outcomes

This framework asserts that the morality of an action is determined by its outcomes or consequences. Let's look at an example of a company who took a look at the outcomes of their decisions and the resulting impacts on the plant. 

> Patagonia, an outdoor apparel and gear company, decided to shift its entire product line to use recycled materials, emphasizing environmental sustainability. This decision was made in line with their consequentialist approach, focusing on the positive outcomes for the planet.

!?[What's next? | Patagonia](https://youtu.be/eV_753wIUzo?si=NaOPwnl3jRpR03kV)

> Patagonia's commitment to using recycled materials led to reduced environmental impact, increased brand loyalty among environmentally-conscious consumers, and positive financial results. The company's decision aligned with consequentialist ethics, as it resulted in both ecological benefits and improved profitability.

**Utilitarianism**, a specific form of consequentialism, emphasizes maximizing overall happiness or minimizing suffering. Individuals following consequentialist ethics will consider the potential consequences of their actions and choose the course of action that results in the greatest good for the greatest number.

Of course, businesses haven't always been focused on attaining good outcomes for stakeholders, or the planet. Let's look at a less-than-ideal consequentialist decision making approach, from the company Enron. 

> Enron, once a leading energy company, engaged in unethical accounting practices to inflate its financial statements, a decision driven by a consequentialist approach aimed at maximizing shareholder value.

!?[Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room movie trailer](https://youtu.be/-w6duQhWuVk?si=bCrSX1JDe7uW1Znk)

> The consequentialist pursuit of immediate profits through fraudulent accounting eventually led to the collapse of Enron. Thousands of employees lost their jobs and life savings, and investors suffered significant financial losses. Enron's unethical actions, driven by a narrow focus on short-term gains, had catastrophic consequences for all stakeholders involved.

These examples illustrate how consequentialist decision-making in business can result in both positive and negative outcomes, depending on the ethical considerations and long-term consequences taken into account.

#### Deontology: The moral compass of duties and principles

Deontological ethics focuses on the inherent nature of actions rather than their outcomes. It emphasizes adherence to moral rules or duties, irrespective of the consequences. **Immanuel Kant's categorical imperative** is a well-known deontological approach that encourages individuals to act according to principles that could be universally applied without contradiction.

> In the early 1980s, Johnson & Johnson faced a severe crisis when some bottles of their Tylenol product were tampered with, resulting in multiple deaths. The company's decision to recall all Tylenol products from store shelves and redesign packaging to prevent tampering aligns with deontological ethics.

!?[Managing the Tylenol crisis](https://youtu.be/jtuvgAkKGqM?si=miUaNQTCcFNG9Lz5)

> Johnson & Johnson's decision reflects the principles of Kant's Categorical Imperative, particularly the principle of treating individuals as ends in themselves, not as means to an end. By prioritizing customer safety over short-term profit, the company demonstrated a commitment to ethical duty and the well-being of its consumers. Johnson & Johnson's ethical response to the Tylenol crisis not only saved lives but also enhanced their reputation as a responsible and trustworthy company. While the short-term financial cost was significant, their deontological approach led to long-term benefits in terms of customer trust and brand loyalty.

While Johnson & Johnson can celebrate the choices they made to support a trustworthy brand, other companies have not faired so well and have not acted in accordance to their values. 

> VW faced a scandal when it was revealed that they had intentionally installed software in their diesel vehicles to manipulate emissions test results, prioritizing short-term profits over environmental and regulatory obligations.

!?[Volkswagen's emissions scandal: A timeline](https://youtu.be/Y5TvFY7xRDM?si=osBvzDn4EQ1Y8eht)

> VW's actions in the emissions scandal directly contradict Kant's Categorical Imperative. They treated regulators and consumers merely as means to achieve financial gain, disregarding their moral duty to act honestly and ethically. Kant's principle of universalizability suggests that VW's actions would lead to a world where companies routinely deceive regulators and customers, undermining trust in the industry. The scandal resulted in substantial fines, lawsuits, and damage to VW's reputation. The company's deontological violation of ethical principles not only harmed its brand but also raised questions about corporate responsibility and trust in the automotive industry.

These contrasting examples serve as vivid illustrations of the profound impact ethical frameworks can have on business decisions. While Johnson & Johnson's deontological commitment to consumer safety, as exemplified in their response to the Tylenol crisis, showcased the enduring importance of moral duty and the Kantian Categorical Imperative, Volkswagen's transgressions revealed the devastating consequences of forsaking ethical principles for short-term gains. 

These cases underscore that in the complex landscape of business ethics, adherence to deontological principles, such as treating individuals as ends in themselves, not as means to an end, is not only a matter of moral duty but also a path towards enduring trust, credibility, and long-term success in the corporate world. In the ever-evolving business landscape, the lessons drawn from these cases remain both instructive and cautionary, inviting us to continually examine the ethical foundations that guide our decisions and actions.

#### Virtue Ethics: Cultivating excellence in character

Virtue ethics places importance on the development of virtuous character traits. It suggests that ethical behavior arises from cultivating virtues like honesty, courage, compassion, and integrity. Instead of following strict rules, individuals using this framework strive to embody virtuous qualities. 

> The Body Shop, a cosmetics and skincare company, has long been committed to ethical and environmentally responsible practices. They prioritize sourcing natural ingredients sustainably and supporting fair trade. This aligns with the virtue ethics approach, emphasizing virtues like environmental stewardship and social responsibility.

!?[At 40, The Body Shop becomes most ethical, sustainable global business](https://youtu.be/nbe-8Y6NfMg?si=mWzTzCV2wTiE3BB9)

> The Body Shop's dedication to virtue ethics has led to a positive brand image, increased customer loyalty, and a reputation for promoting ethical and sustainable business practices. Their commitment to virtues such as integrity, compassion, and environmental consciousness has not only been good for their bottom line but has also made a positive impact on the world.

On an entirely different side of the equation, Wells Fargo faced a scandal when it was revealed that the bank had created millions of fake accounts for customers without their consent, driven by a culture that prioritized aggressive sales targets and short-term profits over ethical virtues.

!?[How high up did the Wells Fargo fake accounts go?](https://youtu.be/wHYYUtoPA4s?si=wa17AXVYykF3f4Mw)

> The unethical behavior at Wells Fargo had severe consequences, including significant financial penalties, damage to the bank's reputation, and the loss of customer trust. This incident serves as a stark reminder that even established organizations can falter when they lose sight of virtue ethics and prioritize profits over integrity and customer well-being.

In the realm of business ethics, virtue ethics stands as a beacon of principled conduct, emphasizing the cultivation of virtuous character traits and ethical values. The Body Shop's unwavering commitment to sustainability and fair trade practices exemplifies how virtue ethics can lead to a positive and enduring impact, fostering trust and loyalty among consumers. Conversely, the Wells Fargo scandal serves as a cautionary tale, illustrating the perils of abandoning virtue ethics for short-term gains. Just as superheroes in the movies often uphold moral virtues to protect the greater good, businesses that prioritize ethical virtues create lasting legacies, while those that falter risk facing their own moral reckoning.

#### Rights-Based Ethics: Upholding fundamental human rights

Rights-based ethics, often associated with the work of philosophers like **John Locke** and **John Stuart Mill**, emphasizes individual rights and freedoms. It asserts that ethical actions are those that respect and protect the rights of individuals, such as the right to life, liberty, and property. 

> Ben & Jerry's, an ice cream company, has long been an advocate for social justice and sustainability. They prioritize supporting various social causes, including fair labor practices and environmental responsibility. This aligns with rights-based ethics, which places a strong emphasis on respecting and upholding the rights of individuals and communities.

!?[How Ben & Jerry’s Activism Helps Scoop Up Customers](https://youtu.be/-L0QyO8SClY?si=IinPwRM1hwgnN-Vw)

> Ben & Jerry's commitment to rights-based ethics has not only cultivated a loyal customer base but has also created a positive impact on society. They actively support fair labor practices, ethical sourcing of ingredients, and community engagement, reflecting their dedication to respecting the rights of workers, farmers, and consumers. Their success demonstrates how adhering to rights-based ethics can lead to both profitability and social progress.

Let's contrast Ben & Jerry's commitment to rights-based ethics to the contrasting case of Nike. While Ben & Jerry's has exemplified how upholding the rights and well-being of workers and communities can foster a positive brand image and drive social progress, the story of Nike underscores the repercussions a company can face when neglecting these fundamental rights. 

> Nike faced significant controversy in the 1990s when reports revealed poor working conditions and low wages in overseas factories where their products were manufactured. The company's prioritization of cost reduction and profit maximization over the rights and well-being of factory workers conflicted with rights-based ethics. 
>
> Nike's violation of rights-based ethics led to widespread protests, boycotts, and damage to its reputation. The negative consequences, including public outrage and legal challenges, served as a stark reminder that disregarding the rights of workers can have severe repercussions for businesses.

The clothes we wear pose an opportunity for human rights violations to occur, as the Nike example shows. An undercover BBC investigation uncovered a distressing reality. Syrian refugee children were found laboring in Turkish factories, producing clothing for prominent British retailers, including Marks and Spencer and online giant ASOS. While these brands assert their strong stance against exploitation and child labor, this report sheds light on the complex issues surrounding labor rights and ethical responsibility within the global supply chain. This disconcerting revelation echoes the concerns raised in the case of Nike's past labor controversies.

!?[Undercover: The refugees who make our clothes - BBC](https://youtu.be/3tf6qc51Kbw?si=xP_iEDBYCBjo4TV7) 

When it comes to business ethics, the lens of rights-based ethics remains a powerful guide, emphasizing the importance of respecting and upholding the fundamental rights of individuals and communities. Ben & Jerry's commitment to social justice and sustainability showcases how adhering to rights-based ethics can not only foster customer loyalty but also drive positive change in society. 

Conversely, Nike's past missteps and the fast fashion industry as a whole underscore the enduring impact of disregarding workers' rights, serving as a cautionary tale for businesses that prioritize profit over ethical responsibility. Just as iconic heroes in literature and cinema champion justice and individual rights, businesses that embrace rights-based ethics have the potential to make a lasting, positive impact on the world while safeguarding their own moral integrity.



#### Social Contract Theory: Navigating morality in collective agreements 

This ethical framework, popularized by thinkers like **Thomas Hobbes** and **Jean-Jacques Rousseau**, posits that ethical norms and rules emerge from social agreements and contracts. It emphasizes the importance of following agreed-upon rules for the stability and well-being of society.

> Starbucks has a longstanding commitment to social responsibility and sustainability. They prioritize fair trade practices, ethical sourcing, and community engagement, aligning with the principles of social contract theory. By respecting the implicit social contract between businesses and society, Starbucks has fostered a positive reputation and customer loyalty.

!?[Follow Starbucks 15 Year Journey to 100% Ethically Sourced Coffee](https://youtu.be/X9g6Z0FYTn8?si=7zJss1EFo9UtqCyQ)

> Starbucks' dedication to social contract theory has led to a positive impact on both their brand and the communities they serve. They actively contribute to the well-being of coffee farmers, support local initiatives, and engage in environmentally friendly practices. This commitment has not only boosted their bottom line but has also solidified their role as a responsible corporate citizen.

One thing careful observers will notice about the Starbucks video is that it was produced by their own media people. While there is nothing wrong with promoting your values as a company to the public (and I do enjoy iced tea from Starbucks on a regular basis), I did a bit more digging and found this [rating for the Starbucks Corporation on the Ethical Consumer website.](https://www.ethicalconsumer.org/company-profile/starbucks-corporation), which didn't place them in as positive of a light. The Ethical Consumer is a UK-based non-profit research, political, and advocacy-oriented publisher which rates companies on their ethical and environmental behavior. 

Let's just say not everyone is going to praise Starbucks for their adherence to social contract theory and environmental and social consciousness. For now, I'm going to keep drinking my iced teas, while also recognizing when I make purchases, I'm voting with our family's finances about the degree to which I'm going to support what a given company does. These are not easy choices and we should all resist thinking in dichotomous ways. 

A company that has had their share of controversy regarding their business practices is Facebook, which was founded by Mark Zuckerberg. Facebook faced public backlash due to issues related to user data privacy and data breaches. Their actions, which disregarded user consent and the implicit social contract of trust, conflicted with the principles of social contract theory.

!?[How Cambridge Analytics exploited the Facebook data of millions](https://youtu.be/mrnXv-g4yKU?si=yGxiYpwi1mmIbMcx)

> Facebook's disregard for the social contract through the Cambridge Analytics scandal and other data breaches have led to public outrage, government investigations, and a loss of user trust. The negative consequences, including legal repercussions and damage to the company's reputation, underscored the importance of respecting the trust and expectations inherent in the social contract between technology companies and their users.

Social contract theory serves as a guiding principle, highlighting the importance of honoring the unspoken agreements between businesses and society. Starbucks' espoused commitment to ethical practices and community engagement exemplifies how adhering to the principles of the social contract can lead to both business success and positive societal impact. Conversely, Facebook's lapses in data privacy and trust demonstrate the profound consequences of neglecting the social contract, serving as a cautionary tale for companies that overlook their responsibilities to their users and the broader community. Businesses that uphold the social contract have the potential to thrive while contributing to the greater good of the communities they serve.

### 03.02 | Why bother learning about ethical frameworks

Before the COVID pandemic hit the world in early 2020, I used to think that all the exercises used to consider ethical frameworks were too theoretical and not realistic enough. I remember while earning my graduate degrees being presented with fictitious cases involving being on a life boat with just two matches, a hot dog, and 22 cotton swabs and trying to determine who was going to get to live. 

I no longer believe that those cases were that far off. More than ever, I find it essential to recognize the ways in which we are using ethical frameworks to guide our decision making and when those values may be in conflict with other people we are collaborating with regarding a decision. Ethical frameworks are essential to learn about for several reasons.

#### Guidance and structure for ethical decision making

Ethical frameworks provide guidance and structure for evaluating ethical dilemmas and making consistent and principled decisions. For instance, when Apple Inc. faced the ethical dilemma of balancing user privacy with national security in the case of the San Bernardino terrorist attack, ethical frameworks helped them navigate the situation. Apple's decision to prioritize user privacy aligns with principles of individual rights, a key aspect of ethical frameworks.

#### Consistency in ethical choices

Ethical frameworks promote consistency in decision making, ensuring that organizations uphold their ethical values regardless of the situation. In the corporate world, companies like Patagonia consistently prioritize environmental sustainability in their business practices. This alignment with their values, guided by ethical principles, has resulted in long-term trust and loyalty from customers who appreciate their ethical stance.

#### Clarity of values and principles

Ethical frameworks help individuals and organizations clarify their core values and principles. For instance, when Johnson & Johnson faced the Tylenol tampering crisis in the 1980s, the company's swift and ethical response demonstrated their commitment to the safety and well-being of consumers. By recalling all Tylenol products and redesigning packaging for tamper resistance, Johnson & Johnson showcased their ethical values and commitment to customer safety. This crisis management strategy aligned with their principles and communicated their ethical stance clearly to the public.

#### Accountability for actions

Understanding ethical frameworks holds individuals and organizations accountable for their actions. A notable case is Enron, where corporate leaders engaged in unethical accounting practices. The Enron scandal led to legal consequences and ethical discussions, highlighting the importance of accountability in the business world.

#### Promotion of critical thinking

Ethical frameworks encourage critical thinking by requiring individuals to consider multiple perspectives. In the film "12 Angry Men," jurors are faced with the ethical dilemma of a murder trial. Through rigorous debate and examination of evidence, they employ ethical reasoning to arrive at a just verdict. This scene of Juror #3 breaking down and pronouncing his decision of "not guilty," illustrates the ways in which ethical frameworks promote critical thinking in decision making and how one person can courageously challenge the status quo.

![12 angry men movie clip](faced with his own short-comings and failures as a father to his own son, Juror #3 (Lee J. Cobb) finally breaks down and pronounces "Not Guilty.")

It's easy for us to think that if we were faced with the same situation, we would stick to our beliefs. However, there's overwhelming evidence that humans are susceptible to bring influenced by others in ways we aren't always conscious of... 

As we learn more about ethical frameworks and how to put them into practice in our own lives, they can serve as valuable tools for navigating the complexities of moral decision making. They help individuals and organizations make ethical choices that align with their values, principles, and societal expectations. Understanding these frameworks enhances moral reasoning and promotes ethical behavior in various personal, professional, and societal contexts.

## 04. Let's not get duped (or pass our ignorance onto others)

![Course lesson graphic 04](https://innovatelearning.s3.amazonaws.com/busn435-course-header-lesson-04.jpg)

It's not fun to look foolish. Yet it's easy to be tricked, given the state of where most of us get our information today: online.

I don't mean to sound offensive in saying the part about sounding ignorant. We're all ignorant about lots of stuff. You should try talking to me sometime about sports, for example, if you want to find someone ignorant on that broad set of subjects. 

The goal is to become more educated about the stuff that is important to us and to know when we don't know enough about something to be a credible source (or know how to spot a credible source). I also want you to be taken seriously in life. A big part of that comes down to being able to identify and communicate effectively about evidence that supports your assertions. 

**Meet a Mikey or maybe two?**

Consider the following (and notice if you can hear a voice associated with these words):

> He likes it. Hey, Mikey. 

If you say these words to someone around my age, they'll likely know exactly what you're talking about. However, since most of you (ok. All of you) are likely younger than me, here's what Mikey was famous for, back when I was a kid.

!?[Commercial for Life Cereal](https://youtu.be/CLQ0LZSnJFE?si=0r5RYZbAG_rtYFPD)

What ever happened to the guy who played Mikey in that commercial? They're sometimes known as urban legends. There was one about Mikey, back in the day. People would talk about how you never see him anymore. Where did Mikey go? Well, it turned out (or so people said) that he had died in the most tragic of ways. 

**It must have been the pop rocks.** 

People said it was some bad combination of pop rocks and Diet Coke. Or maybe just plain Coke? I may be getting my urban legends and actual science experiments (like the one with Mentos and Diet Coke, which really does work) confused. 

How would we have figured out if this was true back at that time? There wasn't an internet to go check. There were newspapers, limited by page and word counts and professional journalists and researcher assistants.

#### Introduction to SIFT

> This course will take you through the basics of quick source and claim-checking, and introduce you to our "four moves", a series of actions to take when encountering claims and sources on the web. 
>
> These course materials can be used for self-study, as part of a formal course, or as a set of independent assignments to practice your skills.
>
> The course is broken up into lessons, each of which can be completed in a single sitting. They take from 20 to 45 minutes, are composed of 5 to 15 pages, and include instruction and a series of exercises. While some exercises may seem repetitive, we recommend you complete them all, as the point is not just learning what fact-checking is, but building a fact-checking *habit*.
>
> The first lesson is a bit longer than the rest, and will introduce you to our basic approach — the "four moves" and the acronym we use to remember them: SIFT. The lesson will take 40 minutes to complete, including all readings, activities, and videos.

###### Vocabulary: claims, sources

- For the purpose of this course, a **claim** is a statement that purports to express something about reality. "The U.S. landed a space craft on the moon in 1969" is a relatively simple claim that is true. "The moon landing of 1969 was fake." is a simple claim that is false. "The mission to land on the moon was driven by Cold War fear more than scientific curiousity" is a complex claim one can have a range of opinions on, but is still, for a given context, either a well-supported claim, a controversial claim, or a claim lacking any real support.
- A **source** is the place where a claim or other information can be found. This course is a source of information about disinformation. Most claims can be found in multiple sources. You might find information about the moon landing in the Wall Street Journal, a website like Gizmodo, a textbook, a research paper, or a video recording of astronauts talking about the mission.

####  The problem with checklist approaches

> We've been doing research into why students fail to separate fact from fiction on the web.
>
> What we've found? Students are bad at the web because they've been taught techniques that make them bad at it. And they've learned those those bad techniques from *teachers*.
>
> Here's some things students often believe:
>
> - They believe that .org's are more trustworthy than .com's.
> - They believe that a good looking layout and few typos mean something is trustworthy.
> - They think pages that have ads on them are less trustworthy than those that don't.
> - They think that footnotes automatically make a site credible.
>
> These are only a few of the (very wrong) things students believe. Before you learn to read the web you may have to unlearn some of the stuff you've been taught.

#### How CRAAP goes astray

![A picture of the CRAAP method with 20+ questions.](https://checkpleasecc.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F0270152f-f0c3-421d-9e54-ae005ffa0f59%2Fcraap.jpg?table=block&id=70c03c84-53e4-48c9-8259-d7094c6876eb&spaceId=092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc&width=1400&userId=&cache=v2)

> Most instruction students get about reading the web is derived from a set of approaches called "checklist approaches".
>
> Sometimes these approaches were presented as literal checklists. Above is a checklist for a methodology called CRAAP. (I'm not joking).
>
> Sometimes they weren't checklists, but a set of "things to look for in a web page."
>
> What the approaches had in common was this: you'd come to a webpage and look for signals that the page was trustworthy on the *page itself*. You'd ask questions like
>
> - Does this look professional?
> - Are there spelling errors?
> - Is there scientific language?
> - Does it use footnotes?
> - The "checklist" idea? Students were told the more "good" things the page had the more "trustworthy" it was.
>
> Except there are three problems with this approach. Big problems.

<article>

##### Problem 1: The signals are meaningless

![Picture of Word document with autocorrect](https://checkpleasecc.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F6c2a4e96-7d12-4448-aeac-5297d6998faf%2Fspellcheck.jpg?table=block&id=36429352-6ca8-48b6-bf09-2f0e48305af8&spaceId=092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc&width=710&userId=&cache=v2))



> Most things people are told to look for? They're easy to fake. It's really cheap to get a good-looking site nowadays. You can be a disinformation agent from China or Russia and still use spell check. Anyone can add footnotes to make something look more serious (students do it all the time!) The same holds for using scientific language.
>
> And a lot of things students are told to look for have no basis in reality at all. In our research we have found students believe
>
> - .orgs are better than .coms (No.)
> - non-profits are better than for-profits (Wrong.)
> - less ads on a page means the page is more reliable (Not even close.)
>
> To put it simply — the things that might mean something are easy to fake, and many things students are taught to look for don't mean anything at all.

</article>

<article>

##### Problem 2: The checklist processes take too long

>Checklist processes were developed for students trying to decide which of a number of library resources to use for a paper. Given that time frame, such an approach might make sense. You can spend 20 minutes looking at each of three journal articles you found to see which would be the best fit for an end of term research project.
>
>In 2019, however, our problem is not deciding between three half-decent library resources over the course of an afternoon. Instead we are forced to sift through hundreds of possible search results and social media posts to try and determine whether each is worth our attention or belief.
>
>Take this TikTok video, for example. In it, one user has made a video that complains about the discontinuation of plastic straws out of what she sees as too high a level of concern about turtles. It's a bit meanly expressed, but that's her point. Another user posts a reaction — by 2050 there will be more plastic in the ocean than fish.

<iframe width="560px" height="800px" allowfullscreen="true" allow="autoplay *" title="duet with at beastmoder247 it is about more than just turtles savetheoceans" src="https://vanguard.instructuremedia.com/embed/a59c0eb3-77da-4741-90db-8b274b102b2b" frameborder="0"></iframe>

>It has literally taken me longer to explain this video than it takes you to watch it. But is the claim true? And what would happen if you had to engage in 20 minutes of investigation for every 10 second piece of content you viewed that made a claim?
>
>Actually, we know what happens when students are given in-depth techniques to deal with the flood of content that reaches them — they don't use them. Without quick methods people decide to share content like this based on whether it seems believable, or worse, they just decide they can't trust anything at all.
>
>The same is true with search. People use search to inform themselves about a variety of professional and civic issues. They search because they need to get information on a specific topic of pressing importance: how to safely change a tire, whether they should see a doctor about a rash, if the mayor's decision regarding panhandling will have a good or bad impact on the homelessness problem.
>
>But the biggest gap is not whether they research deeply. It's whether they check at all. Take that factoid about plastic and 2050. If you could reliably check it in 60 seconds, you might. If not, you're either going to reject it or accept it without checking — mostly unconsciously. Without quick methods to search and sift, your "knowledge" about an issue will slowly become a mental shoebox of unverified scraps you heard here and there around the web.
>
>While short methods may seem less rigorous, they are in fact better than long methods for many tasks. When I switch lanes while driving on the highway, I don't do a ten minute analysis of whether a car *might* be in the lane next to me. I check the mirror, do a head check, and change lanes. If my father had given me a ten minute lane-changing process when teaching me to drive, I wouldn't use it, and frequent accidents would just be a part of my life. This is the sort of thing you need for reading the web as well.

</article>

<article>

##### Problem 3: Using too many criteria results in stupid decisions

>One popular idea is that checklists are important because they force students to evaluate dozens of criteria instead of just a few. But does evaluating more criteria result in better decisions? Many teachers say yes. The research says no.
>
>The problem with having dozens of criteria is that many of them conflict. Readers then get overwhelmed, unsure to which ones they should pay the most attention.[^2] And that produces what I call the "sleazy car salesperson" effect.
>
>Maybe you've had the good fortune to never have to deal with a car dealership. But the way it usually goes is this. You go in to get a car and you just want automatic braking, a rear camera, and satellite radio. What happens? Well, they've got a car that has all three, but it's also the luxury sedan and it's $8,000 more. You do get seat warmers and remote start, which are worth x hundred dollars, and the new side collision detection that's at least $1,000 as an after-market addition. Or you can get this other car that has two features but not the third, and if you add on the aftermarket cost it's less expensive than the luxury car, but you don't get that side collision detection, etc., etc. And... well, it's exhausting even to read that, right?
>
>Car dealers set up cars this way intentionally, so that you can never weigh a couple factors in isolation, which leads to us being cognitively overwhelmed and making bad decisions. The effects of this sort of criteria overload are well-documented, going back decades. Yet methodologies like CRAAP set up processes in the same way.
>
>On a pre-assessment we give to students, for example, we have students evaluate a statistical claim about firearm background checks. The sort of response we see repeatedly is, "Well, it's a .org so it's likely to be trustworthy, but it has an ad on the page so maybe not." It's this is "car lot" cognition. There's a tidal wave of conflicting signals so in the end we throw up our hands and say, "Who can know?"

[^2]: Choices seem like such a good thing, in theory. However, as Mike Caulfield says in the in-depth section of this part of his SIFT course, "Many choices seems promising until you actually have to choose: UB research explains motivation fact..." He then links to [an article in Science Daily](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/06/190613153712.htm), which explains how: "People faced with more options than they can effectively consider want to make a good decision, but feel they're unable to do so, according to the results of a novel study. Despite the apparent opportunities presented by a lot of options, the need to choose creates a 'paralyzing paradox,' according to the authors. 'You want to make a good choice, but feel like you can't.'"

#### Thank you, sir, may I have another

We're back to Mike Caulfield's Check, Please! Starter Course and he's about to get to the main dish: SIFT. All these eating metaphors are making me hungry. 

##### Introducing SIFT

> So if long lists of things to think about only make things worse, how do we get better at sorting truth from fiction from everything in-between?

> Our solution is to give students and others a short list of things to do when looking at a source, and hook each of those things to one or two highly effective web techniques. We call the "things to do" moves and there are four of them:

![Infographic showing the steps of SIFT: Stop, investigate the source, find trusted coverage, trace claims, quotes and media to the original context.](https://checkpleasecc.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Fe3662e32-fba3-4ede-a0a1-3158cac5438b%2Fsift.png?table=block&id=a7a1f341-c590-4253-8f75-48453f8be726&spaceId=092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc&width=1400&userId=&cache=v2)

</article>

<article>

###### Stop

>The first move is the simplest. **STOP** reminds you of two things.
>
>First, when you first hit a page and start to read it — STOP. Ask yourself whether you know and trust the website or source of the information. If you don't, use the other moves to get a sense of what you're looking at. Don't read it or share it until you know what it is.
>
>Second, after you begin the process and use the moves it can be too easy to go down a rabbit hole, chasing after more and more obscure facts or getting lost in a "click cycle". If you feel yourself getting overwhelmed in your fact-checking efforts, STOP and take a second to remind yourself what your goal is. Adjust your strategy if it isn't working. Make sure you approach the problem at the right amount of depth for your purpose.

</article>

<article>

###### Investigate the source

> We'll go more into this move in the next lesson. The key idea is to know what you're reading *before* you read it.
>
> This doesn't mean you have to do a Pulitzer prize-winning investigation into a source before you engage with it. But if you're reading a piece on economics by a Nobel prize-winning economist, you should know that before you read it. Conversely, if you're watching a video on the many benefits of milk consumption that was put out by the dairy industry, you probably want to know that as well.
>
> This doesn't mean the Nobel economist will always be right and that the dairy industry can't ever be trusted. But knowing the expertise and agenda of the source is crucial to your interpretation of what they say. Taking sixty seconds to figure out where it is from *before* reading will help you decide if it is worth your time, and if it is, help you to better understand its significance and trustworthiness.

</article>

<article>

###### Find trusted coverage 

> Sometimes you don't care about the particular article that reaches you. You care about the claim the article is making. You want to know if it is true or false. You want to know if it represents a consensus viewpoint, or if it is the subject of much disagreement.
>
> In this case your best strategy is to ignore the source that reached you and look for other trusted reporting or analysis on the claim. In other words, if you receive an article that says koalas have just been declared extinct from the Save the Koalas Foundation, the winning strategy may be to open up a new tab and find the *best* source you can that covers this, or, just as importantly, scan multiple sources to see what the consensus seems to be. In these cases we encourage you to "find trusted coverage" that better suits your needs — more trusted, more in-depth, or maybe just more varied. We'll show you some techniques to do this sort of thing quickly.
>
> Do you have to agree with the consensus? Absolutely not! But understanding the context and history of a claim will help you better evaluate it.

</article>

<article>

###### Trace claims, quotes, and media back to the original context

> A lot of things you find on the internet have been stripped of context. Maybe there's a video of a fight between two people. But what happened before that? Who started it? What was clipped out of the video and what stayed in? Maybe there's a picture that seems real but the caption is dubious at best. Maybe a claim is made about a new medical treatment supposedly based on a research paper — but you're not certain if the paper supports it.
>
> In these cases we'll have you trace the claim, quote, or media back to the source, so you can see it in its original context and get a sense if the version you saw was accurately presented.

</article>

<article>

###### It's about REcontextualizing

> There's a theme that runs through all of these moves: it's about getting the necessary context to read, view, or listen effectively. And doing that *first*.
>
> One piece of context is who the speaker or publisher is. What's their expertise? What's their agenda? What's their record of fairness or accuracy? So we investigate the source. Just as when you hear a rumor you want to know who the source of it is before reacting to it, when you encounter something on the web you need the same sort of context.
>
> When it comes to claims, a key piece of context includes whether they are broadly accepted or rejected or something in-between. By scanning for other coverage you can see the expert consensus on a claim, learn the history around it, and ultimately land on a better source.
>
> Finally, when evidence is presented with a certain frame — whether a quote or a video or a scientific finding — sometimes it helps to reconstruct the original context in which the photo was taken or research claim made. It can look quite different in context!
>
> In some cases these techniques will show you claims are outright wrong, or that sources are legitimately "bad actors" who are trying to deceive you. But even when material is not intentionally deceptive, the moves do something just as important: they reestablish the context that the web so often strips away, allowing for more fruitful engagement with all digital information.

#### It's time to get those feelings out (in journal form)

You are being introduced to some skills that will be new for most of you. It may start to seem like a lot, so it is time to start capturing the learning in such a way as to be more memorable for you in the coming weeks and months. I've kept notes on SIFT and have even vlogged about my learning in a public way on my YouTube channel. 

##### Your Notebook

> Throughout this course you'll be asked both to do basic fact-checking activities and to think more deeply about the material presented. Here we introduce three things to help you with that.
>
> We ask that you keep a notebook of your fact-checking exercises in a text editor or a word processor like Notepad, Google Docs, or Microsoft Word. If you are taking this as part of a class, you will periodically be asked to submit the contents of your fact-checking notebook for feedback from [your professor and others in the class]. 
>
> The format of the notebook is simple. For each fact-checking assignment you will be given a heading. Write the heading in your document in all capital letters. Then hit enter and answer the questions you are asked to answer. Avoid any fancy formatting as you may have to post this in a format where the formatting will not carry over. 

Here's an example of what your notebook might look like:

![TOXIC FOOD BOWLS | The source here is reputable, an independent organization that hires real journalist, and has won awards](https://checkpleasecc.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Fb3d35e6e-fe12-4566-82c8-56df5dbf0714%2Fnotebook.png?table=block&id=1e665ada-81d5-4603-b007-c43956c1bfef&spaceId=092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc&width=1320&userId=&cache=v2)

At the very end of the course, you'll be asked to pick your favorite example from the notebook and to create a video, which will be shared with others in the class. Keeping links in your notebook will help save you time, later on, when you go to share your learning in a more public way.  

#####  Reflection prompts and vocabulary

Reflection prompts are used to suggest questions for deeper exploration. Each time you see questions for reflection in the course, copy and paste them over to your notebook and prepare to discuss them either during a synchronous class, or asynchronously, through a video or written response. 

###### Questions for reflection

- Do you think media literacy could help some people avoid processes of radicalization? Or are the social drivers too strong?

- Are all conspiracy theories bad? Are all wrong? What do you think makes a conspiracy theory harmful? Do you hold beliefs that others would dismiss as conspiracy theory?
- Do you know anyone that has gone down the conspiracy rabbit hole on an issue? What have you learned from that experience about what drives conspiracy thinking?

</article>

[^1]: Mike Caulfield has asked that people using the [Check, Please! Starter Course](https://checkpleasecc.notion.site/checkpleasecc/Check-Please-Starter-Course-ae34d043575e42828dc2964437ea4eed) include the following note, so people know how to get back to the original: *The text and media of this site, where possible, is released into the CC BY, and free for reuse and revision. We ask people copying this course to leave this note intact, so that students and teachers can find their way back to the original (periodically updated) version if necessary. We also ask librarians and reporters to consider linking to the canonical version.*

The Miseducation of Dylan Roof

>Throughout this course, we'll be using a mixture of both weighty and trivial examples. Sometimes it may seem there's not much downside to being misinformed: who really cares if the "Alexa Voice-Activated Toilet" is real or Monster Brand Caffeinated Ham is fake?
>
>But there are serious social implications to people not paying attention to where their information is coming from.
>
>The video below primarily makes a point about Google. But given the facts presented here, is there a way that a lack of web literacy also played a role?

!?[Video: The miseducation of Dylann Roof](https://youtu.be/qB6A45tA6mE?si=Ids7nDj22uJwIMt1) 

> One of the patterns we see in online radicalization — from Nazism to ISIS — is that people often begin their journey by discovering information on the web from extremists that shocks them. Usually they are unaware — initially — of the source of the information, and if they were aware of the source they might be more skeptical of the information presented. By the time they understand who is supplying the information and what their motives are, they are already aligned with those organizations' viewpoints.
>
> Once a person starts down the conspiracy spiral, it's very hard to get back out. There is such a gap between what they see in "respected" sources and what they see from extremist sites that they come to believe the respected sites must be in on the conspiracy. And while in the past many people might hold one or two conspiracy theories, the hyper-connected, algorithmic nature of the internet creates a situation where believing in one conspiracy theory may lead to your exposure to more and more radical conspiracy theories.

###### Questions for reflection

- Do you think media literacy could help some people avoid processes of radicalization? Or are the social drivers too strong?
- Are all conspiracy theories bad? Are all wrong? What do you think makes a conspiracy theory harmful? Do you hold beliefs that others would dismiss as conspiracy theory?
- Do you know anyone that has gone down the conspiracy rabbit hole on an issue? What have you learned from that experience about what drives conspiracy thinking?

</article>

<article>

#### Conclusion

> In this 30 minute lesson you learned why some traditional approaches to online media literacy don't work, and were introduced to a new approach, encapsulated by the acronym SIFT. This approach favors "moves" rather than analysis, and encourages you to make quick checks before you read material.
>
> Now that we have the basics down we will start practicing some of the web techniques that you can use to get quick answers as you "sift".

</article>

<article>

### 04.02 | Investigate the Source

> One of the four "moves" is to "investigate the source". The following two short videos (less than four minutes) will introduce you to this move. As you'll see, we're not expecting people to do ground-breaking research, just to do some very quick checks.
>
> The first (3:15) video shows how many of the things we think will make us better at the web — raw intelligence, critical thinking skill, familiarity with technology — don't necessarily help:

!?[Online Verification Skills - Video 1: Introductory Video](https://youtu.be/yBU2sDlUbp8?si=cRd-fUMk4OAo-94e)

> The second video (2:45) introduces you to our second move: investigate the source. (In case you forgot the first move already, the first move is "Stop")

#### Just add Wikipedia

> On the previous page you watched a video demonstrating the "Just add Wikipedia" technique. In that case we opened a new tab and fired up a search result page, typing a domain plus "Wikipedia" into the search box. In this next video, we show a variation of that technique that you can do in the omnibar of your browser (that part of the browser in which you can type a web location or a search phrase). We also show how this is particularly helpful for quick research on organizations.

!?[Just add Wikipedia (Source Verification Omnibar Hack)](https://youtu.be/oBqEci8eXXA?si=sToxcnuhc3lH8sN2)

> Notice that while the most relevant Wikipedia article usually floats to the top of results, this is not always true. In the case of researching Nuclear Matters, the most informative Wikipedia page was the second result. When looking at *Before It's News* the first Wikipedia result that came up was the right one — but it was second in the Google results, after a result from Rational Wiki.

</article>

<article>

#### Use Surprise as an Indicator

> What do you look for on the Wikipedia page? It varies. Sometimes — as with the Nuclear Matters material in the video above — what sticks out most is the agenda of the group, e.g. something you thought was a research group turns out to be a political advocacy group with ties to the industry. Sometimes it's the fact that a source has a history of unreliability, as was the case with *Before It's News*. And many times (most, actually!) it will turn out the source just fine, as we saw above with the *SacBee* example.
>
> But rather than a checklist of things to look for on the Wikipedia page, I want you to focus on two organizing questions:
>
> - Is the site or organization I am researching what I thought it was?
> - If not, does it make it more or less trustworthy?
>
> If you thought something was from a straight news site and it turns out to be from a conspiracy site, that should surprise you. And given your new knowledge, your initial impression of the trustworthiness should plummet. If you thought you were looking at a minor, unknown newspaper and it turns out to be a multi-award winning national newspaper of record, maybe your assessment of its trustworthiness increases. The effects on trust are of course contextual as well: a small local paper may be a great source for local news, but a lousy source for health advice or international politics.

###### Vocabulary: paper of record

A national paper of record is a reputable paper that attempts to cover all important national news with staff reporters. They are distinguished from regional and local papers which use staff primarily for local or regional news.

</article>

</article>

#### What's Important Depends On Context

> What you take note of when doing investigate the source searches will be highly dependent on how you initially interpreted the source.
>
> As an example, I remember looking at a comment on Twitter from what I thought was an internet rando. He was talking about a historical point with a lot of confidence. I thought it was an interesting point, but not worthy of my attention. Out of habit I did a Wikipedia check on his name and found that he was a world renowned historian who had written the most popular textbook on the subject at hand. Surprise! I went back and read his comment more carefully and thought about it more deeply.
>
> Conversely, I've occasionally seen newspapers on the web that seem to me (in the names and the way they look) like old established papers. Throwing their name into a *just add Wikipedia* search I find they don't have a Wikipedia page (odd if the paper is supposed to be a major paper) or that they were established less than two years ago. Neither of those outcomes means the paper is not to be trusted, but it might change the way I read it or prompt me to do more research.
>
> Note that there can't be any hard and fast rule here — there's not a list of rules that says writing a textbook on the subject is good, not having a Wikipedia page is bad. But a lot of this is obvious in the specific case.
>
> One caveat — some students, used to just reacting to claims, may not be forming conscious opinions of what a source is. If this is the case with you, take just the smallest fraction of a second to think about what you think you are looking at before you research it. Do you think this is a major news source? A local paper? A government database? A grassroots, people-powered movement? A professional organization? As we go through the course we'll talk more about some of these categories of sources.

Vocabulary: grassroots, professional organization

- **Grassroots organizations** are organizations which are primarily run and funded by interested citizens and independent activists.
- **Professional organizations** provide an array of services and support to people in a given field. An organization for electrical engineer may provide professional standards to follow, research on best practices, training for members, and lobbying for the field.

#### SIFTing: Alexa-enabled toilet? (prompt)

> Each of our "Sifting" exercises will give you a scenario, show you a prompt associated with it, and ask you a question associated with it. You should "use your moves" on the prompt (the components of SIFT), then write your results in your notebook. If you are a student in a class, when you write your results in your notebook, make sure to use the specified heading, so that your teacher knows what prompt you are responding to.
>
> We start the course with some pretty light exercises. So here's your first exercise. A friend sends you a text about a new "Alexa Toilet":

![SMS message with text "Great, now there's an Alexa microphone in the bathroom too"](https://checkpleasecc.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Fdb279215-906a-498a-93fd-66c73d6687f7%2Ftoilet1.png?table=block&id=c5108c12-f468-4dc4-92d6-4557aed780ee&spaceId=092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc&width=690&userId=&cache=v2)

Visit the [story on Tom's Guide about the Kohler Alexa toilet](https://www.tomsguide.com/us/kohler-numi-alexa-toilet,news-28957.html) and perform the activity described below: 

> Now we could use our "Find Trusted Coverage" move here. But let's hold off on that. The question I want you to investigate is:
>
> - Is Tom's Guide a known product review site or something else?
>
> Use the **Investigate the Source** move, find out what you can. In your notebook, write the heading ALEXA TOILET, hit enter and tell us what you found out.
>
> When you are done, go to the next part to see how a fact-checker might approach this problem.

</article>

<article>

#### SIFTing: Alexa toilet (discussion)

> Here's an example of what a fact-checker might say:
>
> **ALEXA TOILET**
>
> According to Wikipedia, Tom's Guide is a publication run by the people who run Tom's Hardware, a very old and well known product review site. You can find this in the Wikipedia article on Tom's Hardware in the Related Publications section, and if you want to be super sure, click the linked footnote that talks more about the site and confirms this is the right URL for it. It seems like a trusted source for this kind of news.
>
> How did we find that out? We used the Just add Wikipedia trick:

![GIF showing someone typing http://tomsguide.com wikipedia into their web browser and viewing some info about Tom's Hardware](https://file.notion.so/f/f/092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc/2223113f-0fa8-408f-a663-64083a1f9524/toms-guide1.gif?id=2f5f9113-2049-44b4-9d7e-16876465d7f5&table=block&spaceId=092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc&expirationTimestamp=1704427200000&signature=D9s0HdWATVlflwgOAGti86EnPnxr87CBmqe3B374F_U)

> We searched for the site (adding our bare keyword "wikipedia"), and found the most relevant Wikipedia page at the top of the results. It wasn't an exact match, but it was close enough to check it out.
>
> Clicking through to the Wikipedia article Tom's Hardware, we searched (using either control or command-f) for the phrase Tom's Guide on the page, and found it in Related Publications.
>
> This is probably enough to state it's a legitimate site for this sort of story, but if we wanted to be extra sure that the Tom's Guide mentioned here is tomsguide.com, there is a footnote on that part of the Wikipedia page, and if we follow it we find this:
>
> **Los Angeles - September 18, 2007 - TG Publishing LLC (www.tgpublishing.net) a Bestofmedia Group company, one of the top-three online media publishing companies for technology in the world, announced today the rebrand of Gear Digest to Tom's Guide (www.tomsguide.com). Tom's Guide is the definitive online resource for unbiased and trusted information on the latest consumer electronics and technology gear.**
>
> That's a press release from the group that runs Tom's Guide, so it might not be a great resource for some things, but for the purpose of confirming the URL is a match it's perfect. Less than sixty seconds of effort and we know this is a real site and likely a real story. Share the Alexa toilet story with anybody you desire.
>
> Take a look at the answer in your notes. How did you do in your investigation? If you want to touch up your answer having read this, go ahead. 
>
> Although not shown in the animation, we used "control-f" to search for information on the web page. If you are familiar with control-f (command-f on a Mac) continue on with the lesson. But if not, [watch this video on how to find a word on a web page with control-F](https://youtu.be/D-FkKwRD4iY?si=8aq3kaUsf8D0hj5n) and [check out this article on using control-f on the web](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/08/crazy-90-percent-of-people-dont-know-how-to-use-ctrl-f/243840/) — we'll be using it a lot.

<article>

#### Wikipedia

> Wikipedia is broadly misunderstood by faculty and students alike. While Wikipedia must be approached with caution, especially with articles that are covering contentious subjects or evolving events, it is often the best source to get a consensus viewpoint on a subject. Because the Wikipedia community has strict rules about sourcing facts to reliable sources, and because authors must adopt a neutral point of view, its articles are often the best available introduction to a subject on the web.
>
> The focus on sourcing all claims has another beneficial effect. If you can find a claim expressed in a Wikipedia article, you can almost always follow the footnote on the claim to a reliable source. Scholars, reporters, and students can all benefit from using Wikipedia to quickly find authoritative sources for claims.
>
> As an example, consider a situation where you need to source a claim that the Dallas 2016 police shooter was motivated by hatred of police officers. Wikipedia will summarize what is known about his motives and, more importantly, will source each claim, as follows:
>
> **Chief Brown said that Johnson, who was black, was upset about recent police shootings and the Black Lives Matter movement, and "stated he wanted to kill white people, especially white officers."[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_shooting_of_Dallas_police_officers#cite_note-NBC.Shot-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_shooting_of_Dallas_police_officers#cite_note-ShapiroSuspect-5) A friend and former coworker of Johnson's described him as "always [being] distrustful of the police."[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_shooting_of_Dallas_police_officers#cite_note-DallasNews.Know-61) Another former coworker said he seemed "very affected" by recent police shootings of black men.[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_shooting_of_Dallas_police_officers#cite_note-DallasNews.Complex-64) A friend said that Johnson had [anger management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anger_management) problems and would repeatedly watch video of the 1991 beating of [Rodney King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_King) by police officers.[[85]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_shooting_of_Dallas_police_officers#cite_note-85)**
>
> Investigators found no ties between Johnson and international terrorist or domestic extremist groups.[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_shooting_of_Dallas_police_officers#cite_note-nprwhatweknow-66)
>
> Each footnote leads to a source that the community has deemed reliable. The article as a whole contains over 160 footnotes. If you are researching a complex question, starting with the resources and summaries provided by Wikipedia can give you a substantial running start on an issue.

If I had to pick one of the two I would pick the first TV station (abcnews4) in this case because they are more local to the event (they are in Charleston, the city where it happened) vs. the KDVR story which seems to just be reprinting someone else's story (and is in Denver, not South Carolina!)

> How do we get there? We start by doing our "just add wikipedia" trick. Let's show the ABC one first:

#### When are local sources good?

> Here's our first reflection: we often talk about authority being "contextual and constructed." Let's take that "contextual" piece. An organization that might have authority in one area, but won't have the same level of authority in all areas. For example, a fitness instructor might be a great person for advice on a fitness routine, but you wouldn't get medical advice from them. Likewise, you might ask your doctor about an illness or medical condition, but you wouldn't expect them to be an expert in aerobics.
>
> Local and national newspapers employ reporters that have very similar skills, much more similar than fitness instructors and doctors. But even here authority differs depending on the type of story. For your first reflection, think of a sort of story where a local paper would have a high degree of authority. Then think of another sort of story where they might have far less authority.

###### Questions for reflection

- For what sort of other stories might a local source be a particularly good authority?
- For what sort of other stories might a local source not be a good authority?

![Search the URL and add Wikipedia](https://file.notion.so/f/f/092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc/cf2ec0a4-6114-44e1-9664-56b4ef5ce498/volcano1.gif?id=97f137ee-3a02-40ba-b640-6b41a97061bf&table=block&spaceId=092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc&expirationTimestamp=1704427200000&signature=28vk_1iqJnQSMCaEYJLLwbf7Ffxf1THOoGn1lVFUMuo)

> We search the URL or domain and add our bare keyword `wikipedia`. Selecting the most relevant search result we find it is a known satire site.

#### A note about Buzzfeed

> One thing you'll notice in the Wikipedia article is that Buzzfeed News is cited as source. Students are often confused by this, since they are most used to Buzzfeed being primarily a source of videos such as "I tried to eat five popular candies from Romania and this is what happened."
>
> That Buzzfeed site isn't good news source for very much. It's not "fake", but it's not very serious. Years ago, however, Buzzfeed spun off a reliable, award winning news publication under the name "Buzzfeed News" (domain: www.buzzfeednews.com). And harkening back to our "contextual authority" discussion earlier, it turns out that Buzzfeed News has two of the top experts in the world on the "fake news" phenomenon. So when you see a link to Buzzfeed News on question about the trustworthiness of a site, it's well worth following.

#### The Problem of Fauxtire

> One problem — larger in the past, but still extant — is the problem of "fauxtire". Experts on disinformation use the term fauxtire to describe sites such as World News Daily Report which claimed to be satire sites (like the Onion) but in practice were not linked to because people thought they were funny but because people were fooled into thinking the stories were real.
>
> This presents an interesting problem — if you run a site that is supposedly a humor site, but in practice it is convincing people of awful things, are you responsible for that? What if you intentionally tweak satirical headlines so they are more likely to deceive people (and hence make you more money from ads)?

###### Questions for Reflection

- What are your feelings on fauxtire? Is it an ethical practice?
- Should companies like Facebook and Twitter downrank articles if they are being spread based on the impression they are "real" when they are not? What are the dangers of that?

</article>

<article>

#### Conclusion

> You finished lesson two! In the past thirty minutes, you've learned about one "move" (investigate the source) and one web technique associated with it ("just add wikipedia").
>
> Next up we'll apply what you learned about investigating the source to a couple specific issues.

</article>

### 04.03 | Further Investigation

> Let's put our investigate the source (the "I" in SIFT) move to use. We'll look into the problem of state-controlled media, and show you a variation of the "just add wikipedia" technique that you can use for individuals and organizations without websites.
>
> Ready to get started?

#### MH17 (prompt)

> For this exercise, you'll need a bit of background. MH17 was a passenger plane shot down by Ukrainian separatists. Take one minute to watch this short video on the history of the crash.

!?[Video: Investigation finds MH17 was hit by a Russian-made missile](https://youtu.be/74BmEkgNRNY?si=mET-cJzi-ZAfZj0G)

> Looking only at issues around the source (and not the article itself), which of the following publishers is a better source on the downing of MH17 and why?

1. [Russians, Ukrainian to face murder charges over downing of Flight MH17]((https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-mh17/russians-ukrainian-to-face-murder-charges-over-downing-of-flight-mh17-idUSKCN1TJ30G/))

2. [Video: Error message, video is not available in your country](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEvUHfjS3Ig)

Spoiler alert. When Mike designed this exercise, that second video was available. However, since then, when trying to access the video, we get an error message saying that the video is not available in our country. You're probably guessing (correctly) that the first source (Reuters) is a better source to learn more about the downing of MH17 than Russian tv would have been. 

Pronunciation guide: 

?[How to say Reuters]((https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/transcoded/1/18/Reuters_%28spoken_word%29.ogg/Reuters_%28spoken_word%29.ogg.mp3))

If we really wanted to see the video, we could make use of the Internet Wayback Machine, but for now, I think it's ok to skip that extra step. Since you couldn't view the video, in all likelihood, just head over to Wikipedia and see what it has to share with us about RT.com. 

[RT (TV Network)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RT_(TV_network))

You will learn more about the specifics related to the MH17 flight in the next section (discussion). 

#### MH17 (discussion)

> You probably noticed in the initial video evidence strongly suggests elements of the Russian government were involved with the downing of the flight, though the targeting of the passenger plane was likely a mistake.
>
> Given this, it would be odd to trust RT on the issue, since the Wikipedia article on RT shows that RT (formerly *Russia Today*) is seen by many to be a propaganda tool of the Russian government.
>
> How did we find that information? We started by doing our "just add wikipedia" trick. Let's show the Reuters one first:

![GIF showing the "just add wikipedia" moves in checking out Reuters.com](https://file.notion.so/f/f/092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc/6376aecc-e95c-406c-986b-7be1faea6ffa/reuters-mh17.gif?id=dfcfaf5d-90cc-4a34-b392-3df109b312ae&table=block&spaceId=092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc&expirationTimestamp=1704477600000&signature=wkTiWazsszOeORa1VVg8pwyxnTR0GVhYJVis2Gdos4Q)

> We search the URL or domain and add our bare keyword "wikipedia". Selecting the most relevant search result, we find Reuters is an international news organization. Scanning the article we note that there have been a few controversies related to timidity with climate change reporting and allegations of anti-Israel bias, but nothing that relates to this subject.
>
> What about RT?

![An animated GIF showing the 'just add Wikipedia' moves in checking out rt.com](https://file.notion.so/f/f/092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc/74f18012-7723-4ed2-86e1-5d30f5c3d79f/rt-mh17.gif?id=281d2872-4ce2-4e22-8dce-1693671e6afd&table=block&spaceId=092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc&expirationTimestamp=1704477600000&signature=eJrufsauirHQJw0A3FKhu5NEgaoQ8VuX0KnkHHXUtLg)



> We do the same search for the URL or domain adding our bare keyword "wikipedia". As mentioned above, when we click through to the article we notice it is funded by the Russian government. Government funding is not necessarily bad, but scroll further we note that there are credible accusations it is a government propaganda outlet. In this case, read Reuters, a credible international news agency, and ditch RT.

#### Controversies on Wikipedia Pages

> One of the more difficult things for students is evaluating controversies on Wikipedia pages. Almost any paper of significant size and history will have controversies. So what counts? When scanning controversies quickly, it's worthwhile to look for a couple things.
>
> First, is there evidence of outright deception or the embracing of conspiracy theories? Direct government influence? An agenda that is explicitly focused on propaganda? Things that are intentional or patterns of behavior mean more than ocassional error.
>
> Second, if errors are noted are they related to the topic you are looking at? A paper that has published sloppy reporting on health claims, for example, might be okay on political news. And papers with biased opinion columns are often home to quality reporting. But if you are looking at a health claim and the controversies are around health, that may be a different story.
>
> As always, stop and be strategic about your research — the question is usually whether a particular source good enough, or if there are enough questions around it that you should find better coverage. You don't have to prove RT lied about MH17, for example. 
>
> **You just have to read enough of the Wikipedia page to realize you shouldn't be reading coverage from state-controlled media on this issue, especially since the state in question was likely involved in the event.**

#### Government manipulation of online media

> Russia is not alone in using influence to spread disinformation — many countries pursue such actions internally, and a number, like Russia and Iran, attempt to sow discord in other nations. Read the following (very short) article on state sponsored influence operations:

The original link that Mike had in his course is no longer available. Again, if crucial to our research, we could use the Internet Wayback Machine to locate it. However, in searching the present-day internet to find it, I did locate this related article that may help us discover more about why YouTube (which is owned by Google) would have blocked that last YouTube video from Mike's mini course.

[Facebook, Google and Twitter limit ads over Russia's invasion of Ukraine, by Shannon Bond](https://www.npr.org/2022/02/26/1083291122/russia-ukraine-facebook-google-youtube-twitter)

###### Questions for reflection

- What obligations do American companies have to prevent this sort of use of their platforms? 
- What responsibilities belong with the reader instead?

#### Expertise and reputation

> Evaluating expertise is hard. And we're not going to show you how to do that in any fine grained way.
>
> But we will show you how to sanity-check expertise, to see if they are known to have expertise in their area or more pseudo than science, more salesperson than professional.

!?[Video: Mike Caulfield presents about expertise](https://youtu.be/yU9JELSQGfU)

> The first example uses our "Just add Wikipedia" trick.  In the second example we show we used:
>
> - Google News Search https://www.google.com/search?tbm=nws&source=hp&q=news+query+here&oq=
> - Google Scholar: https://scholar.google.com/

#### Warming claims (prompt)

> Here's an article by a guest author, Myles Allen, arguing that climate change is incredibly serious but that the way some activists are talking about the recent IPCC report (considered to be the scientific consensus on global warming) is at times alarmist. We are going down a very dangerous road if we don't act on climate change now, Allen agrees, but he also says the idea that most people will feel world-ending impacts in twelve years is not supported.

[The problem with claiming we have '12 years to climate breakdown, by Myles Allen in RealClear Science'](https://www.realclearscience.com/articles/2019/04/24/the_problem_with_claiming_we_have_12_years_to_climate_breakdown.html)

> In this case, since Allen is not a reporter but instead presented as an expert. Check out his expertise by doing a Wikipedia search on his name. You'll have to use a bit of creativity here — but replace the domain name you've been searching on with his name.
>
> Is he well qualified to write this article? Why or why not?
>
> (Again, remember it's not about whether you think he is right or wrong here. We just want to know if his opinion here is worth considering and why.)

#### Warming claims (discussion)

> We check for Myles Allen in Wikipedia with the search `myles allen wikipedia`. There's a substantial chance he won't be in Wikipedia even if he *is* an expert, but it's a good first step to check there.
>
> In this case, we luck out! He's in there:

![Animated GIF showing wikipedia search results for Myles Allen](https://file.notion.so/f/f/092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc/02d63bc8-b10d-4833-85dd-e8808c6a9b9e/myles.gif?id=5831a803-1219-4605-9bf4-5ff77fc010e5&table=block&spaceId=092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc&expirationTimestamp=1704477600000&signature=srrIfNk3ZW876gcywvnEwpltKBuk3oQiuvHhkBob65o)

> Look at the Wikipedia article and then look (skim, really) his opinion piece. Does he have relevant expertise? Double check the answer in your fact-checking notebook and write down your assessment of the writer's expertise.

Questions for reflection
- One of the understandings key to media literacy is "authority is constructed and contextual".  Different communities (scientists, reporters, politicians, psychologists, car mechanics) have different criteria for authority (constructed) and the type and level of authority you need may depend on your context (contextual).  What other types of expertise could this issue benefit from?

#### Smoke-free (prompt)

> Here's a summary of a report from an organization called Foundation for a Smoke-Free World. They want to eliminate smoking worldwide.

[Global Trends in Nicotine]((https://www.smokefreeworld.org/advancing-industry-transformation/global-trends-nicotine/))

> For this example, do a Google News search on the foundation name. Is there anything in particular we should know about this organization before reading their materials? Describe what you found out and what sources you used in your fact-checking notebook. Use the heading SMOKE-FREE.

#### Smoke-free (discussion)

> In this case we use a Google News Search. There's multiple results, but we scan the little "keyword in context" blurbs to find relevant coverage.

![GIF showing the search for Foundation for a Smoke-Free World](https://file.notion.so/f/f/092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc/4310bbd7-b18c-45a7-83bf-42747867c450/smokefreeworld.gif?id=e140a218-9f54-43b2-b9a7-3047ba5d0b66&table=block&spaceId=092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc&expirationTimestamp=1704477600000&signature=F6KsToi4ibmBTLrrYnFQsMDWxWST2RVrCM7XP5YmBEY)

> We choose the source PRWatch. PRWatch isn't a perfect source — they've been accused at times of having an anti-corporate bias — but in general their reporting is well-sourced.
>
> When we go to that article (or many of the other articles on that page) we find that there is some debate about whether the tobacco-industry funded Foundation for a Smoke-Free World should be seen as a research and advocacy organization. Part of that debate centers around its initial funding (it was founded with a large grant from the tobacco industry). But the critique of it from researchers is more subtle than that — they point out that the proportion of money spent on marketing to that spent on research is not indicative of a research organization. And you can see that some of those researchers [wrote that in a letter](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(19)31347-9/fulltext#%20) to one of the more prestigious English-language health journals, the *Lancet*.
>
> Even given all this, you might come to a conclusion that this organization is trustworthy, at least in some limited contexts. Or maybe not. But either way, it's crucial to know about the debate about this organization before you engage with (or share) its materials.

#### Bias vs. Agenda

> The above issue gets at an important distinction when looking at sources. Students often come to media literacy thinking that the primary thing they should be concerned about is bias. And since everyone has some form of bias, that ultimately leads to students thinking no one can really be trusted.
>
> Personal bias has real impacts. But bias isn’t agenda, and it's agenda that should be your primary concern for quick checks.
>
> Bias is about how people see things; agenda is about what a news or research organization is set up to *do*. A site that clearly marks opinion columns as opinion, employs dozens of fact-checkers, hires professional reporters, and takes care to be transparent about sources, methods, and conflicts of interest is less likely to be driven by political agenda than a site that does not do these things. And this holds true even if the reporters themselves may have personal bias. Good process and good culture goes a long way to mitigating personal bias.
>
> You saw this in the introductory videos on the American College of Pediatricians. The main issue was not that the organization was biased, or even that was small (though this mattered somewhat). The main issue was that it didn't seem to be set up as a research or professional organization. It seemed, in fact, to be set up as a political advocacy organization.
>
> Similarly, in this instance even though the tobacco industry has a long history of deception the researchers are not ruling out that it might be funding some good work. It's possible, even if suspicious.
>
> What they are alleging is that the structure of the organization resembles a marketing organization more than a research organization, and that as such its research should be looked upon with some suspicion.
>
> Again, you need to come to your own conclusion on whether that assessment is damning. But whether you agree with the researchers or not, adopt their approach. Ask first and foremost when approaching an organization or source "What is this group set up to do?"

#### Conclusion

> You finished lesson three! In the past thirty minutes, you've expanded your knowledge of how to investigate sources. Three new techniques were introduced:
>
> - "Just add wikipedia", but for names and organizations
> - Google Scholar searches for verifying expertise
> - Google News searches for information about organizations and individuals
>
> Additionally, you learned
>
> - What state media is, and how to identify it
> - The difference between bias and agenda, and why it matters

### 04.04 | Find Trusted Coverage

> We've covered:
>
> (S)top!
>
> (I)nvestigate the source
>
> And now we get to F: Find trusted coverage.
>
> Sometimes when you investigate the source you'll find that the source is sufficient for your needs. We saw, for instance, an article on global warming written by a person that was an expert on the impact of climate change, and even though their point — that some activists were exaggerating climate impacts — was annoying to some on both the left and the right, we saw the opinion and analysis worthy of our attention.
>
> Sometimes we can't determine the reliability of the source. And most of the time we don't really care about the source at all. We just want to get an accurate story on the subject from somewhere.
> When the initial source you encounter is low quality and you just care about the claim your best strategy might be to find a better source altogether. We're going to show you how to do that in this lesson.
>
> But first a story about Keanu Reeves.

#### Quick checks for other reporting: Keanu Reeves

> Celebrity death hoaxes happen from time to time — in fact, one of the first big viral pieces of web fakery was a 2001 report that Britney Spears had died in a car crash. So when we see news that a celebrity has died, it's good to be cautious.
>
> On the other hand, we're not monsters. If someone did actually die — whether Prince or Tom Petty or a favorite YouTube star — we'd like to express our emotions about it. We'd like to share the news with others. It's emotional, and we don't want to treat it like a research project. Luckily, it really isn't hard to see if something is a death hoax or not. Just check trusted coverage.
>
> How do you do this? Well, consider this report that "Keanu Reeves is dead."

![Image of a headline saying that Keanu Reeves has died in a snowboard accident](https://checkpleasecc.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F32c8aa2a-6fed-44c7-8dba-d0dcf91d3bfe%2Fkeanu-reeves-died-in-snowboard-accident.jpg?table=block&id=1ab6281c-abd9-4d27-8331-d43bff53bd64&spaceId=092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc&width=1080&userId=&cache=v2)

> Is it true? If it was, we'd expect there to be lots of news stories about it. So we check.

![GIF showing that Keanu Reeves was very much alive as that headline was claiming he had died](https://file.notion.so/f/f/092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc/29fef051-eaa5-467b-99c7-e2f152a204f7/keanu-snowboard-ibn.gif?id=e25dea8c-db83-4461-990c-83102e42665d&table=block&spaceId=092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc&expirationTimestamp=1704477600000&signature=t8tLBUIGP31zYKkmhX-3n8Cc24CcrcZ5i0dM_Iqw8XQ)

> What do we find? The top stories about Keanu Reeves are about him making a surprise stop to sign a fan's yard sign. Doesn't sound very dead! Just to be sure, we search for `Keanu Reeves dead` and the only thing that comes up are stories about how a video game with "Death" in the title almost featured Reeves.
>
> Conclusion: Keanu Reeves is not dead.

#### Most big stories get covered by multiple outlets

> What does it look like when some one actually *has* died? This is a bit morbid, but the morning I am writing this MMA boxer Maxim Dadashev passed away due to injuries sustained in a fight. He was a minor figure you've probably not heard of, and yet when we search `Maxim Dadashev dead` in Google News search we find there are already multiple stories confirming this.

![GIF showing Maxim Dadas has died](https://file.notion.so/f/f/092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc/d91c05f1-a47f-4196-a397-cad91c7b6625/mmaboxer-usa-today-barekeyword.gif?id=65d496a2-fcf4-48fc-aad8-4a326038e832&table=block&spaceId=092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc&expirationTimestamp=1704477600000&signature=IZGQqCtWdAW-8USVIxmBBnJAaFtnGjqoUXoaZI3vJEM)

> We click through to the USA Today story here, but we really didn't need to. Just seeing this many results on the news page is good enough for us to believe a claim of this sort. Go ahead and share this story, comment on it, and feel what emotions you have to.

###### Questions for reflection

- Why did we search for Keanu Reeves instead of Keanu Reeves snowboard?
- Why do you think so many otherwise smart people make errors when it comes to death hoaxes? What are the emotional drivers? What are the social incentives that push people not to check?

#### Using fact-checks from news search: Chik-Fil-A

Once I get a song in my head, I often have it floating around in there for quite some time. As soon as I saw Chik-Fil-A in this headline, I just had to share this one. It's such a good song, and maybe you've been sitting a while and need to take a quick mental break.  

!?[Louis Jordan Ain't Nobody Here But Us Chickens 1956](https://youtu.be/HnyB0a8G71Y?si=wdkH4kmxxp62vq6M)

Ok. We had better get back, right? Back to Mike Caulfield, gettin' us SIFTing along... 

> In our Keanu Reeves example, the absence of any news stories was telling. But many times when you use Google News (or other news search) you'll find something better: a fact-check on the claim.
>
> Let's take a story circulating as I write this, one claiming a Georgia lawmaker believed she was told by a Chik-Fil-A employee to "go back to her country" but later clarified that she was mistaken.

![Headline: Georgia lawmaker claims Chick-Fil-A employee told her to go back to her country, later clarifies he actually said 'my pleasure'](https://checkpleasecc.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F3cd210fb-17c1-4d9b-b6de-52d849b51b41%2Fbabylon-bee.webp?table=block&id=7276d21f-889c-4bab-8c88-30bfd52c6dcc&spaceId=092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc&width=1400&userId=&cache=v2)

> In this case we do the news search, and we do find something: a fact-check by Snopes:

![GIF of Google search for Chick-Fil-A Georgia county](https://file.notion.so/f/f/092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc/e2ef7116-44ce-42a8-8849-7586de0c0048/chik-fil-a-lawmaker.gif?id=7c8a2c17-5b67-4a5d-b5ad-8dc3433108d2&table=block&spaceId=092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc&expirationTimestamp=1704477600000&signature=OPycIXSHPgP30eLIIWrMbW1cOKgn3XWK_1qboiyoCY8)



> The Snopes fact-check labels this as false, but more importantly it presents the background in detail: a similar incident happened at another store sometime earlier, but the *Babylon Bee* is a satirical publication that created a very similar (but false) story.
>
> Snopes initially gave this story a "false" rating, but many objected, claiming that the site did not attempt to hide it was satire, and labeling satirical articles as false was unfair (and a bit humorless!). Snopes made a counterargument that *Babylon Bee* articles were repeatedly shared by readers as true, due to a deceptive way the *Bee* constructs articles (a practice sometimes called fauxtire). Eventually Snopes relented and introduced a new ruling: "labelled satire."
>
> So was Snopes right in the initial ruling? Wrong? Somewhere in between? Was this a case of semi-intentional deception, or just satire not funny enough for people to recognize as satire? 
>
> Here's the thing: people can get twisted in knots over the ruling, and both sides can go into outrage over the unfairness of it all, but for you as a fact-checker the ruling doesn't matter so much. It's the fact-checking article that is most valuable to you. 
>
> Fact-checks are useful to web readers because they are designed to give a concise explanation of particular claims and because good fact checks (like good Wikipedia articles) show their work by linking to high quality sources that you can look at yourself. The ruling is helpful, but isn't what matters most: it's the explanation and all the links they've compiled for you. If you doubt this ruling, you can click to the site itself and see that both sides have a point, the *Babylon Bee* bills themselves as a satirical publication, although, as Snopes initially noted, this is not made as clear as it might be.



###### Questions for Reflection

- The *Babylon Bee* has been criticized by many for repeatedly writing satire that is not notably satirical enough for people to recognize it as a joke. Critics say that this is reckless, as most people will develop false impressions from reading the headlines that float past on Facebook. What are your thoughts on this? Some links on this issue are included at the bottom of the page.

- If people are sharing a story as if it is true, it makes sense for Snopes to fact-check it. But is "False" the correct rating for satire or fauxtire? Look at the [ratings Snopes uses](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check-ratings/) and develop two arguments: one argument that Snopes should introduce a new category of "satire", and one argument that it should not.

- Even if you disagree with the rating of false, does the Snopes article give you enough information to make up your own mind?

#### Scanning Results Using "Click Restraint"

> Some times a search on a claim will turn up multiple stories, many of which are not relevant. Consider this bit of viral news that circulated on Facebook:
>
> **You know when you go to Walmart and they have the wipes to clean your cart handle? How many of you don’t use them? Well I do, and I always thought of the germs only. Was told today that the police chief also suggests you do it also because of all the problems with drugs now days, and if they have fentanyl or something like that still on their hands and they touch that cart handle and then you do, it can get into your system. Scary but worth taking the time to clean the handle. All you’d have to do is rub your nose or touch your child’s mouth.**
>
> Searching initially on just fentanyl shopping cart gives a mixed bag of results.

![search results for fentanyl shopping carts](https://checkpleasecc.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Faeccbad2-60c6-4555-83d9-237dcbc3a8c9%2Ffentanyl-click-restraint.png?table=block&id=f6d4005f-5562-4079-9687-44d86d4485d8&spaceId=092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc&width=1280&userId=&cache=v2)

> When we scan the blurbs we find that the first article — even though it is from a reputable source — contains the words fentanyl and shopping cart, but is not really about fentanyl on shopping carts. Likewise, the reference to shopping carts in the second one is to homelessness, not grocery store drug scares. It's the text of the third result that's in line with what we're researching, and that's the one we want to click. (Though once getting there we may want to use our source investigation techniques on Forbes).

###### Vocabulary: click restraint

- **Click restraint** is a term introduced by Sam Wineburg and Sarah McGrew to describe a behavior fact-checkers exhibit that less skilled people do not. Fact-checkers scan multiple results to try and find the particular result that combines trustworthiness with relevance before they click, often visiting the second page of search results.

#### Remember to Stop

> This brings us to the move that often gets forgotten by students: the "S" in SIFT for "stop." As seen above, one aspect of "stopping" is to stop before you reflexively click the top search result. You want to take a second or two to make sure you're clicking the best result, not just the first one you see.
>
> Another aspect of stopping is occasionally reformulating a search. We do see one fact-check in the above results, but perhaps we're surprised we don't see more. Maybe we start reading the Forbes story but find it unclear. If the results are not what we want we can modify the search query, here by adding "fact-check".

![GIF showing fentanyl grocery cart fact check](https://file.notion.so/f/f/092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc/c3a91350-a6af-4be8-87e5-d378b695fd06/fentanyl-shopping-cart-fact-check.gif?id=c6cb61a9-a406-43ad-bcf5-7253bdfa1c69&table=block&spaceId=092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc&expirationTimestamp=1704477600000&signature=VW62nGC4LEiQZ7j3Y9rS3g3hlYbhyXZKAtgqxp-P56w)

> When we do that we see at least a half dozen fact-checks on this from Poynter (a well known fact-checking outfit), CBS News, and others. We choose the CBS News link and find a good explanation of why the fentanyl story is highly improbable, combined with advice that wiping those handles during flu season is something you might want to do anyway.

#### Not Everything In Google News Is Credible

> Although we mentioned this earlier in the course, it bears repeating. Using news search can give you a more trustworthy set of results than web search, but there are still untrustworthy sites in the mix, including a few that publish outright false information.
>
> The same way that you practice click restraint in looking for the most relevant link, you should also practice click restraint and choose the most credible result on the page. It won't always be the first. As we practice this more, choosing the best result will become much easier.

#### SIFTing: UN Dance Protesting Nikki Haley (Prompt)

> Early in 2018 the Trump administration announced that it would withdraw financial support for Palestine unless the country agreed to concessions. U.S. Ambassador Nicki Haley presented the U.S. position on the matter to the U.N. in January.
>
> Then, according to many people on Twitter, something amazing happened. In defiance of the Nicki Haley's pronouncement, the Palestinian delegation got up... and began to dance!

![Screenshot of Sacha Saeen showing what was claimed to be dancing in protest](https://checkpleasecc.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Feaed5dd9-14c1-486b-9644-7421b4961d1f%2Fpalestiniandance.png?table=block&id=e5494464-1feb-46f6-b833-74ad1139baea&spaceId=092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc&width=1240&userId=&cache=v2)

> Text reads: "The Palestinian representative played a song on his mobile phone & danced at the UN as a response to Nikki Haley announcing that the U.S. will be cutting aid to Palestinians unless they recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital."
>
> Fact check this, then answer the following questions in your fact-checking notebook under the heading UN DANCE:

###### Questions

- Is the video unaltered (i.e., a "real" video)?

- Is this video really a reaction to U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley?
- What else can you tell us about this video, and how do you know it?

#### SIFTing: UN Dance Protesting Nikki Haley (Discussion)

> So let's take a look:

![Search for UN dance protest and resulting story on Snopes](https://file.notion.so/f/f/092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc/bf1f55a2-728b-457d-a7ed-2f6a80d4d8fc/haley-un.gif?id=1761eccb-c55f-4cf8-8d4a-0147d19733a5&table=block&spaceId=092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc&expirationTimestamp=1704477600000&signature=Y57vwvEuahlhtzmFvmnXy1J3ShCD8t07Jv2OHUXmigA)

> In this case we could just click the fact-check we see in the general search, assuming we either recognized Snopes or Al-Araby as a reputable source. If we don't recognize those sources or see relevant material, we click into Google News.
>
> Our finding? The clip is miscaptioned. It's not from 2018, it's not about Trump or Nikki Haley or protest. It's an enjoyable but rather unremarkable clip of a 2013 event where a famous Palestinian singer was invited to sing at the United Nations.

#### False Frames

> While there are videos and photos that are fake or manipulated online, a far more common tactic is to take real media and miscaption it. The example above is pretty blatant. But often it is more subtle — and more dangerous.
>
> Take for example this infamous tweet that was posted after the London Bridge bombing.

![photo 'framed' with reference to terror attack](https://checkpleasecc.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F9641551f-5986-48e8-9353-1e1cb2df3e35%2F620.jpg?table=block&id=2ff151f8-21a4-4d8a-a04c-aac3a4b8c2b7&spaceId=092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc&width=1210&userId=&cache=v2)

> The picture is real, but the way the poster would like you to see it is not. The frame here is that a woman wearing a hijab cares so little about victims of Islamic extremist violence that she won't even look up from her phone.
>
> The image pinged around the web with that story, and while this version has blurred out the face, the face was not blurred in the original. People believed this specific woman was a monster.
>
> But was that the frame through which they should have viewed it? After the photo and false frame had circulated through the web the real story emerged. The poster had chosen one of two photos, with the second photo showing that she was clearly in shock:

![Woman with her head covered, looking upset and distraught](https://checkpleasecc.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Fd4e999c3-ed0b-4176-8cfb-bb8fed7733af%2Flondon-attack-woman_2.jpg?table=block&id=82c955d3-2167-46d4-bb45-cb2cb32f7563&spaceId=092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc&width=1400&userId=&cache=v2)

> When news outlets contacted the photographer, he said the woman was like many people that day walking past — she would have just come through a much more devastating scene, and been in shock, and the rescuing teams did not want assistance, they wanted space to do their jobs. Many people were on their phones as they tried to reach relatives. The photo the poster didn't choose clearly shows the trauma and concern.

![people gathered around someone lying on the ground | Reuters/Toby Melville. Used under fair use provision](https://checkpleasecc.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F345a0a17-f3e0-4e53-965a-f05f2cab922e%2Flondon-attack-bridge1.jpg?table=block&id=ce089b16-f9b8-4d86-8589-9c14d08d31a0&spaceId=092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc&width=1400&userId=&cache=v2)

> Because of the falsely framed photo the woman was viciously attacked by others on social media. When contacted by reporters, she mentioned she was [calling her family](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/mar/24/woman-hijab-westminster-bridge-attack-victim-photo-misappropriated) to tell them she was OK:
>
> **She said her feelings at the time were of sadness, fear and concern, and added that she had talked to other witnesses to try to find out what was happening and see if she could offer help. She then called her family and helped a woman get to Waterloo station.**

#### Sharpening the Event

> Some frames aren't wholly false, but are sharpened to the point where they are deceptive. An example of this sort of sharpening was the 2019 Covington student altercation with a Native American drummer in Washington D.C.
>
> In this case, initial footage was shared on Twitter and through other outlets that seemed to show Catholic high school students wearing Make America Great Again hats surrounding a Native elder during a drumming ceremony to mock him.
>
> The characterization was not completely incorrect. But the reaction to the video was heavily influenced by the starting point of the edit. While the framing of the video initially made it seem as if the students surrounded the drummer to mock him, later videos that emerged showed that the drummer had in fact approached the students.
>
> Discussing these things can be difficult, because even after the frame is corrected, the original intensity of feeling still remains. It's particularly hard in this case, because in the full video there are still questions to be asked about appropriate conduct and cultural respect.
>
> But one's emotional reaction to students who actively surround an older man as a mob and block his exit in order to mock his culture is different than one's reaction to watching students respond inappropriately to an older man that approaches them in what they feel is a confusing manner.
>
> In this case both sides lost. Had the longer video been released first, a productive discussion might have been possible. Instead, the initial video fired one group of people into a frenzy, while the revelations of subsequent videos caused the other side to dismiss the behavior entirely.
>
> We'll come back to this point later, when we talk about the "T" in SIFT. But for now remember that even if photos and videos are "real" it's important to check trusted sources to make sure you have the whole story. If it turns out you were reacting to something manipulated or falsely framed, consider that your initial reaction was wrong, and adjust accordingly.

#### SIFTing: ATM rats (prompt)

> Take a look at this story about a rat eating ATM cash in India.

![John D'oh account: "That's an expensive lunch!" With a headline Rat dies after gorging on cash while stuck in ATM from mandatory.com](https://innovatelearning.s3.amazonaws.com/2024-01-04_09-57-19.jpg)

> We could look and see if "mandatory.com" is trustworthy, but in this case that's not really what we care about. We just want to know if this story been reported by reputable sources. 
>
> Go to Google News search and see if other sites are reporting this. If there are other sites, choose the site you feel is the best source for this story. If it does not appear to be true, explain how you came to that conclusion.
>
> Enter the results in your fact-checking notebook under the heading ATM RATS.

#### SIFTing: ATM rats (discussion)

> Let's take a look!

![Google search for atm rat cash india](https://file.notion.so/f/f/092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc/8353bf62-c19f-4cda-8965-c9a99b38536e/atm-rat.gif?id=3c7d8e0d-d502-4759-8a64-13669066ad44&table=block&spaceId=092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc&expirationTimestamp=1704477600000&signature=6theBjPB5Lb6AjfY1VKstQjShqEOMnzxUXcrn9-Odyk)

> In this case there's a lot of good sources on that search page. I chose Reuters, due to their expertise with international reporting, but most choices here are fine. At the time I did this search I saw Newsweek, USA Today, BBC News, Thrillist (a culture site), and Business Insider.
>
> What is our response here? Well it might be something like this:
>
> **The story appears to be true — Google News shows it being reported by multiple outlets including some reputable outlets I recognize. I chose the Reuters article, and looked up Reuters on Wikipedia before reading it. It's a well-known news agency with an international focus. The story itself to me seems a bit fishy (I mean really!?) and maybe I'm just a little suspicious that the camera didn't catch the rat going into the ATM. But the idea the rat ate (or shredded, technically) the money is in fact the consensus of both reporters and the bank authority there, so I'm inclined to go with their take on it.**
>
> One thing to note here: a lot of people get hung up on whether something could possibly be false. And it's good that people are suspicious. There are sloppy reporters out there, and government regulators don't always tell the truth.
>
> But doubt is a position too. Your mileage may vary, but for me, even though I can imagine a scenario in my head where someone steals some money from the ATM then shreds the remaining money and tosses a dead rat in there to blame it on, the truth is I am 13,000 miles away from this event, have not reviewed any of the evidence directly, don't know the local environment, the trustworthiness of the people involved, the sequence of events.
>
> Under such circumstances it's fine to say, yeah, for the moment — given there is a whole universe of police and reporters out there looking at this with resources and insights and skills I don't have — it's most likely that the rat really ate the money. **If new evidence emerges, you can change your mind.**
>
> This is a really subtle point, and we'll talk about it more later.

#### Trading Up

> Often we get trustworthy news from not so trustworthy places. Maximum.com might be a great site, but it's unlikely, in this case, that they individually verified a story in India. They are just re-reporting it. Social media exacerbates the issue, since which article reaches you is more determined by the clickbaity-ness of their headline than the quality of their reporting.
>
> By searching a claim and getting a story from a news source that has a verification process in place you not only verify the claim, but you end up with a better story to share with others. We call this "trading up." The idea behind trading up is that you can use social media to discover stories relevant to you, but when you find the stories, take a moment to "zoom out" and get the best reporting or analysis on it, rather than simply reading the specific article that happens to find its way to you.
>
> When you use social media in this way, you let social media do what it does best (personalized topic discovery) while relying on either news or other search to address social media's big problem (credibility, clickbait, manipulation). If you find a better story on the subject, share that story instead, and in doing so make social media a bit better for everyone.

#### How to use reverse image search to Find Trusted Coverage

> Sometimes (many times!) claims or stories will come to you in the form of images. If you want to find trusted coverage of the issue, claim, or photo, you have a couple options:
>
> - You can search on some relevant text from the image, if, for example it is a meme or a supposed photograph of a sign
> - You can use reverse image search. We show you how to do this in Google Chrome below, but other browsers have similar methods.
>
> Keep in mind that if reverse image search (bullet #2) is difficult due to the device or browser you are using, you can usually get pretty far with the text search of Google Images. 
>
> Watch the video, then go to the next page to check your skills.

######  Questions

Answer the following questions in your fact-checking notebook:

- Is the photo real and unaltered?
- Is this really a photo of John Lennon signing an album for his killer?
- What else do you know about the photograph?



#### SIFTing: John Lennon's murderer? (discussion)

> We show one way to approach the issue below.  Remember to enter the results of your investigation in your notebook.

![Mike Caulfield fact checks the John Lennon autograph photo](https://youtu.be/g62-JZHXmYY)

> In this case the photo is real, and the framing of the photo (that Lennon is signing an album for his killer) is accurate.

#### A quick note from Dr. B about failure

I'm writing these words on January 4, 2024 (Dr. B). I wanted to break in here and say something about being wrong. I am going through the SIFT modules, again, despite having done so years ago. I use Safari for my web browser, so don't have quite as easy a time doing the reverse-image search as Mike shows in his video and GIFs. Long story short, I wound up finding the story in a tabloid and thought it was therefore fake. When I rewatched Mike's video, I discovered that I had both remembered wrong and followed down a rabbit trail that didn't pay off. 

All of us are going to be wrong in our lives. The strange thing about failure is how much it can benefit us, if we let it. Cognitive researcher Robert Bjork runs a memory lab at UCLA. When I got to talk to him for my podcast, years ago, he said some memorable words. 

> Forgetting is the friend of learning. 
>
> --Robert Bjork

I know it is easy for me to say not to worry if you're not getting all of these prompts right on your first try. Too much of education focuses on high stakes assessments, which don't always measure what they claim to... Now back to our regularly-scheduled program: aka Mike Caulfield. 

#### Why Not Examine the Photo Itself?

> One question I get asked from time to time is why I encourage people to look for trusted coverage rather than examine the photo itself for photoshopping. Many people have the experience of having seen something that is obviously fake. So why not look for signs of fakery?

#### ![one of the many examples of the internet meme 'this looks shopped'](https://checkpleasecc.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F6f430e8a-c7e5-428a-81f5-3a4d73bf8a95%2FShopped_sea1.jpg?table=block&id=1cf6a0f2-a67d-431f-8b6c-5e36ddbe1ef0&spaceId=092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc&width=1000&userId=&cache=v2)

> In practice we've found that this approach fails for a number of reasons. The biggest reason? 
>
> Let's provide an example first. The following image is presented online as evidence of a chemical spill in Hungary.

![photo of trees with the lower parts of the trunks all turned brown](https://checkpleasecc.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F50553306-0f83-400d-a307-ba8255345b81%2Ftrees-mining-sludge1.jpg?table=block&id=ce039f9a-8207-4ab9-bcf1-9eddafe09871&spaceId=092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc&width=1630&userId=&cache=v2)



> Is it shopped? Most people would say yes. But, actually, it *isn't*. It's really the effect of one of the worst industrial accidents in recent European history:

Watch: [Video of the tsunami of toxic sludge in Southwest Hungary](https://youtu.be/vjf4e7ZAc9M?si=fkTbmqHo4miNtG71) (2:18m)

> That's an extreme example, with a very weird looking picture, but stare at any image long enough and you'll find something wrong with it. Unless you're an expert in digital manipulation (you're not), it's better to find trusted commentary than pull out the magnifying glass.

###### Questions 

- When would a reverse-image search be more helpful? 
- When would it be more of a waste of time to do a reverse-image search as part of your fact checking? 

#### Conclusion

> In this section you've learned to find trusted coverage when trying to determine if a claim is reliable. You learned three techniques:
>
> - Scanning Google News for relevant stories
> - Using known fact-checking sites
> - Reverse image searching to find relevant sources on an image
>
> Next we'll look at our final move: Tracing claims, quotes, and media to the original context.



### 04.05 | Trace Claims, Quotes, and Media to Their Original Context

> Most stuff you see on the web is not original reporting or research. Instead, it is often commentary on the re-reporting of re-reporting on some original story or piece of research. And that's a problem.
>
> Now, in some cases stories or findings get better as they pass through intermediaries. If I tell a reporter a piece of gossip I heard, and they go out and verify it by talking to eyewitnesses and experts, their report on my piece of gossip is probably more accurate than my gossip. If a scientist gets a result and another scientist with a talent for explaining things blogs it, maybe the second explanation is better than the first. Research also shows that as gossip gets passed around, sometimes important details that were missed become more prominent.
>
> But in most cases, the more a story is passed around, the more it starts to become a bit warped. That's due to a bunch of reasons. Human nature is to exaggerate stories for effect. Desire of websites to get advertising dollars can result in them printing the most shocking version of something. And there are bad actors: people who will take a story that has some nuance to it and remove the details that provide that nuance, or invent details that didn't exist.
>
> Very often by the time a story finds you on the web it has been altered so much that it presents a radically wrong version of an event or a piece of research. The person you are reading usually did no original reporting, made no phone calls to check facts, and often barely skimmed the original story before writing up their blog post, thinkpiece, hot take, or re-reported news item. And so they either get things wrong by mistake, or, in some cases, intentionally mislead.

#### Trace It to the Original

> Fortunately, there is a solution to this problem. Usually, the original reporting, research, or photo is available on the web. By going to the original reporting or research source (or finding a high quality secondary source that did the hard work of verification) you can get a story that is more complete, or a research finding that is more accurate. This two minute video shows you how going to the source can be as easy as clicking through a link:

!?[Online verification skills - Video 3 - find the original source](https://youtu.be/tRZ-N3OvvUs)

#### Leveling, Sharpening, and Assimilation

> Early studies of rumors suggested that as rumors traveled further from the source they were altered in predictable ways. They were"leveled" — as they traveled, details are stripped out. They are also "sharpened" — certain small details are added or emphasized to give the story more "punch". And both of these processes happened in the context of "assimilation" — the details that were omitted and the details that were added or emphasized are chosen because they either fit what the speaker thinks is the main theme of the story, or what the speaker thinks the listener will be most interested in.
>
> Later research called into question the particular nature of these processes, but these three actions are a helpful way of thinking about the sorts of alterations people can make to claims, quotes, and media as they pass them along.
>
> These processes are not necessarily bad. It means that as a story travels it often becomes more concise, more engaging, and more geared toward the interest of its audience. Think of a long-winded story full of details that someone has told you which you have then retold. Assuming you have a credible take on what the story is about, you'll probably forget the irrelevant details, and remember the most memorable ones. So when you retell it, you'll provide a shorter more engaging version customized to your audience. And that's good! One reason many people enjoy getting news from social media is it can be much more *efficient* than a longer news story, calling out the pieces that really matter to you in particular.
>
> But the same way that these processes can provide value in the hands of careful storytellers, they can be damaging in the hands of those who are careless, are guided by strong bias, or are motivated to distort the truth for their own benefit.
>
> Consider this tweet from our old friend John D'oh:

![John D'oh tweets "It might be time to ditch the sunscreen"; headline from moms.com says FDA warns chemicals from sunscreen enter your bloodstream after one day](https://innovatelearning.s3.amazonaws.com/2024-01-04_10-45-18.jpg)

> John is tweeting his takeaway from this article on sunscreen (or at least his takeaway from the article headline):

![Headline from moms.com: FDA warns chemicals from sunscreen enter your bloodstream after one day](https://checkpleasecc.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F568e64df-105a-4850-8013-e9a6742c4f83%2Fchemicals.png?table=block&id=e00512e0-42d7-4ae4-a65e-4e54bea484e5&spaceId=092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc&width=1510&userId=&cache=v2)

> But the article doesn't say to ditch your sunscreen. And it doesn't even say that the FDA is warning people about the chemicals. The study merely concluded that given the levels of the chemicals in the bloodstream — from applying sunscreen four times a day — that additional regulation might be warranted:
>
> > They found that these 24 participants had higher than what is recommended of these chemicals in their blood. This amount is based on what the FDA’s says is how much of these active ingredient can be in someone’s bloodstream before it needs to be tested for safety concerns...
>
> This article isn't from a reliable source, and is in fact pulling all its quotes from another article. It's reporting on reporting. If you click through to the link (supposedly to the research article) it links to a CNN story.
>
> And in that story you notice the re-reporters left something out:
>
> > So, should you stop using sunscreen? Absolutely not, experts say.
> >
> > "Studies need to be performed to evaluate this finding and determine whether there are true medical implications to absorption of certain ingredients," said Yale School of Medicine dermatologist Dr. David Leffell, a spokesman for the American Academy of Dermatology. He added that in the meantime, people should "continue to be aggressive about sun protection."
>
> The original story *actually says the opposite* of what the tweeter proposed.
>
> You could trace it back even further, but we can stop there. A story came out that mentioned the research, but made it clear that there is not any known danger yet, and that people should continue to use the sunscreen they are using in the meantime. That gets rewritten, with that detail omitted or downplayed (leveled). It then gets summarized by John D'oh — who "sharpens" the advice, and ends up stating the exact opposite of what the original story said.
>
> When looking at information of this sort, figure out what the original reporting source was, and go take a look. Some publications can add value, particularly if reporters are experienced and knowledgeable in the field they are reporting in. But if it's clear the thing your looking at is just re-reporting of reporting, go up to the source and once at the source do your normal (I)nvestigate the Source moves.

#### Beware the Sourceless Story

> Consider this post by John D'oh, in which he references [an article from Curious Mind Magazine](https://curiousmindmagazine.com/research-shows-born-creative-geniuses-education-dumb-us/):



![John D'oh tweet: "I've said it before and will say it again -- school kills creativity. Looks like NASA agrees with me, according to this research"](https://innovatelearning.s3.amazonaws.com/2024-01-04_11-01-06.jpg)

> If you go to that story you'll find references to a "NASA study" — however, when you click on the link it's not to the study (which was apparently from 1968) but rather to a summary of the study in an information technology magazine from the 2005. The study itself appears to never have been published directly or reported on contemporaneously. You can keep digging, and what you'll eventually find is what citations that exist to the study are not to the 1968 study, but a 1992 book Land wrote with his wife which told the story of the study he had done over 20 years before. Importantly the study wasn't even a NASA study: it was a study he did privately using a test that he had developed for NASA. It's unclear what NASA's take was on the test, since, again, the only account we have of it is from 1992.
>
> This is not to doubt Land's honesty. But the perceived authority of the study for many readers comes from the idea it was conducted by NASA and was substantial research at the time. When you attempt to trace the claim to the original context you find that the trail ends in 1992, it was not published at the time, and was not conducted by NASA. That changes how you might view the claim.

#### Beer tax (prompt)

> Take a look at [the tweet](https://x.com/JuddLegum/status/935512580155731968?s=20) below, which links to [a story from think progress.org](https://thinkprogress.org/alcohol-tax-cuts-c62a5bb7e90f/).

![Judd Legum tweet: Provision quietly tucked in GOP tax bill could lead to 1k people dying every year](/Users/bonni/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20240104110852747.png)

> You see multiple sources here, but what's the *original* research source? Click through until you find the original report.

Once you find the original report answer two questions in your fact-checking notebook:

- What is the reputation of the organization or person producing the report? How credible are they on this claim?
- What's the 1,000 people dying about? How does an alcohol tax affect that?

#### Beer tax (discussion)

> To solve this, we click to the page linked in the tweet, and scan it for links to the original report (or the original summary of the report). We find one such link:

![a segment of the page with the phrase "report estimates that" highlighted. "Estimates" is linked.](https://checkpleasecc.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F32cc436d-3717-420f-add6-7b795fe2c1f8%2Fbeertax.png?table=block&id=17b7b2de-0068-4bd6-8d9a-c0939adbeccd&spaceId=092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc&width=1470&userId=&cache=v2)

> That report seems to be the source of the claim, so we click through and find a summary of the finding from Adam Looney at the Brookings institution. And he has a link that shows his math.

![Headline: Measuring the loss of life from the senate's tax cuts for alcohol producers; with 'read more here on how I arrived at this estimate' highlighted and linked ](https://checkpleasecc.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F4ffb6854-7cc0-4776-bddf-ddad1c9a9d6d%2FUntitled.png?table=block&id=049093c9-3ddc-41c5-8de2-78cc16fdca45&spaceId=092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc&width=2000&userId=&cache=v2)

> The truth is we're not (most of us) risk researchers or even working economists. We're not going to be able to judge whether he is being fair about the math, whether he's citing consensus risk models or fringe stuff. We only have his reputation to go by.
>
> It's a contentious issue, with a lot of complexity, so our goal here is not figuring out whether he is right. Our goal is to figure out how seriously to take that estimate. Is it junk, or is it worth considering? Do we keep reading, or do we go somewhere else?
>
> So our second move, now that we *know* the original source, is to *investigate* the source.

> In this case, a search for Brookings on Wikipedia shows that Brookings is a well respected think-tank that conducts this sort of policy analysis regularly, has a high marks for credibility, and seems to be centrist in political leanings, and not explicitly partisan.

#### Your Research Shopping Cart

> The search above gave you a good result on Brookings — good enough for you to take the analysis seriously, in any case. Good enough for you to share this with others if that's what you want to do.
>
> But I cannot stress enough that it doesn't mean you have to agree with the analysis. In fact, if you want to form an informed opinion on this question, you probably want to move to that (F) in SIFT, and find other trusted coverage on this issue of alcohol taxes and death rates. See what others say.
>
> Students (and even teachers, sometimes) often want these things to resolve one way or another. Is this person right, or are they wrong? True or false? With some questions there's that sort of clarity, and we shouldn't hesitate to make simple judgments when simple judgments are merited.
>
> For something like this, however, I like to think of it like food shopping. Maybe you're interested in this question of alcohol taxes. You go around the information supermarket, and you look at the (metaphorical) nutrition labels, and the question is not "Is this the only thing I will eat?" The question "Is this healthy enough to go in the shopping cart?"
>
> The above analysis is healthy enough to go in the cart, and healthy enough to share with others. But if you have questions or concerns you should keep shopping! Just make sure that for the additional sources you consume you check those nutrition labels too.

#### Guns in schools (prompt) 

> The NRA — a political advocacy organization — currently argues that the correct response to school shootings is arming teachers and school personnel. In light of that position, a pro-gun control organization called Everytown circulated the following graphic:

!["We believe in absolutely gun-free, zero tolerance, totally safe schools. That means no guns in America's schools period." - Wayne LaPierre](https://checkpleasecc.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F0c8900e7-1240-4530-b321-e18e9e2194f2%2Fdwppqasw4ausrnp.jpg?table=block&id=7e3c3a4c-adcb-4173-9bb4-29d72776ae36&spaceId=092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc&width=1630&userId=&cache=v2)

> If NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre said that in 1999, it looks like a dramatic change in approach.
>
> Find the source of the quote, and read it in it's original context. For this one, do not stop at a fact-checker, but track the quote all the way to the transcript of the C-Span video where he said it.

###### Questions

- Do you feel this portrayal of a major shift in policy is fair? Why or why not?

#### Guns in schools (discussion)

> There are numerous fact-checks of this out there, but we asked you to look at the source of the quote itself in this instance. To do that you can either find it directly through search, or be lazy like me: go to a fact-checking page and click through to the video linked in it. Most fact-checkers link to the C-SPAN video:

[NRA convention video on CSPAN](https://www.c-span.org/video/?122961-1/national-rifle-association-convention&start=2290)

> People may have different opinions on whether the Everytown graphic is accurate. It's certainly the case that he seems to be primarily talking about *students* not having guns. On the other hand, the "rare exception" language seems to indicate that the 1999 version of Wayne LaPierre would not have dreamed of saying *teachers* should carry weapons. 
>
> As with so many of our examples, the truth is a bit more nuanced than it appears at first. And while knowing the nuance may not change your opinion on the issue, understanding what is genuinely new here will help better focus your efforts on the things you care about, no matter which side of the issue you find yourself on.

The video compared the Sustainable Development Goals to a birthday cake

[][ ][[ ]] True
[[x]] False

Hint: It was a type of cake, yes, but was it a birthday cake, or some other type? 



Which one of the following was NOT one of the ways that the video suggested a company could organize their goals to align with the SDGs?

[[ ]] Environmental goals

[[ ]] Employee goals

[[ ]] Community goals

[[ ]] Worldwide goals



You notice that the U.S. is performing higher than a less-developed country in the SDGs. Explain why solely looking at that measure may be misleading. 

Which of the two SDGs are you most personally interested in learning more about and finding out how you may be able to contribute to improving around the world? In your answer, link to the information about each of the two goals you list from the [17 goals websiteLinks to an external site.](https://sdgs.un.org/goals). For example, if you were interested in ensuring sustainable consumption and production patterns, you would link to that goals' page: [https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal12Links to an external site.](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal12) 

EXAMPLE:

[Goal 12: Ensure sustainable consumption and production patternsLinks to an external site.](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal12) - I'm interested in this goal because when I think about how much food gets wasted just in our family, it pains me to extend that out to the world... Currently, our consumption patterns are built to continue and even extend those habits. This one also interests me as it relates to fast fashion, which is [shared about on the SDB websiteLinks to an external site.](https://sdgs.un.org/news/conscious-fashion-and-lifestyle-action-network-25073). 

Answers should include:

1. Number and name of goal
2. Linked to goal on UN website
3. 2-3 sentences explaining why you have a personal interest in that particular goal (this should read as a personal reflection and not something copied from somewhere else)
