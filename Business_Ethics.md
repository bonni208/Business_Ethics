# Business Ethics

I am so glad you're here. While I have taught this class well over ten times, each time feels a little different. In the Spring of 2024, I burned the class down to the ground and rebuilt it in a format inspired by some of the greatest teachers I have ever met[^1]. I am so looking forward to our class becoming an us in the coming weeks. 

> Watch the following video to get to know a few things about me, as well as discover a bit about our class. 

<iframe width="100%" height="580" allowfullscreen="true" allow="autoplay *" title="busn435-welcome-video-walk" src="https://vanguard.instructuremedia.com/embed/cba6c2a1-32b3-4a4f-b01e-6e14dd3a132c" frameborder="0"></iframe>

**Design**

This course is designed to be engaging, challenging, and practical, encouraging you to think deeply about your roles in shaping the ethical landscape of business. My hope is that you will 'show up' for it in the fullness of who you are and that together we will cultivate the kind of environment that is necessary for that kind of vulnerability to be possible. The class is made up of ten lessons and ten challenges[^2]. Each lesson is designed to generate curiosity and help reinforce the relevance of the content. Each challenge provides opportunities to apply the learning in your unique context and to take time out for personal reflection. 

At certain parts of my life, I have felt stuck deciding on what seemed like two, binary choices. Like those old fashioned tv game shows where you had to pick door A or door B. 

![Game show in the style of 1950s with two doors as choices: A or B][image-1]

Someone I worked with reminded me that there are hardly only just two options we might pick in our lives. The options are boundless. But, also, Henry Nouwen reminds us in the following quote that God is with us, through all the choices we make in our life and we can rest easy in that. 

> There is no such thing as the right place, the right job, the right calling or ministry. I can be happy or unhappy in all situations. I am sure of it, because I have been … deciding to do this, that, or the other for the next five, ten, or twenty years is no great decision. Turning fully, unconditionally, and without fear to God is. Yet this awareness sets me free.
> 
> -- Henry J.M. Nouwen 

Thank you for taking the time out of your week to get started with Business Ethics (aka BUSN 435). 

![LEGO bricks - AI generated - university campus][image-2]

*While not an actual LEGO set you can buy (nor am I quite that huge in real life), I'm looking forward to us being able to use our creativity together this semester to create something memorable. Not sold in stores. Not available in real life. Not Vanguard's actual campus. Not absent of bias.[^3] You get the idea...* 

## 00. Let's get it started

![course header - lesson one][image-3]

Welcome to Business Ethics (BUSN435) at Vanguard University. Throughout your experience of taking ten lessons and then experiencing ten challenges, you will grapple with essential questions about living a life of character and remaining true to your faith within the context of business. My aim is to equip you with the tools and insights necessary to navigate the complex landscape of ethical decision-making in the business world while upholding the values and principles rooted in your beliefs. Through these experiences, I hope to empower you to become an ethical leader who inspires positive change and positively impacts your professional and personal spheres.

> As you progress through this lesson, be sure to watch the videos, read the text, and answer the review questions are you are presented with them. More information is available on Canvas about what's expected, along with due dates, etc. 

One thing you're going to find about me is that I love music. Almost 100% of the time, there's a soundtrack playing in my head. So, if someone says something like: "Let's get it started," my mind is going instantly to music. Like [this song by The Black Eyed Peas][4]. 

> I know I just told you to be sure to watch all the videos. YOU CAN SKIP THIS ONE, because it is just a song. Unless you are really ready to get it started. 😂🎯🎉

Let's go. 

### 00.01 | Why take a business ethics class

Speaking of decisions, there are likely many reasons a person may decide to take a class about business ethics. 

**Requirement.** I often hear people say that they needed it to meet some requirement (whether that be for accounting majors to hit the number of units they need to eventually earn a CPA license someday, or for a business major who needs upper division business elective units). 

**Flexibility.** Sometimes students tell me that the flexibility of the course gave them the option to design their schedule to meet their needs (whether that be because they're an athlete and they can better navigate practice times and games, or because their work schedule requires a class structure like this one. 

**The professor.** Finally, some people say that they have had me for classes, previously, and that they're excited for another adventure together. I don't take that lightly, as it is truly a joy to get to learn with others and I'm glad you have decided to take another class with me. 

**You're not sure \~ yet.** It's also quite possible you don't know yet why you're taking this class. Perhaps as you put together your schedule, everything didn't fall into place like you had hoped it would. My encouragement to you is to consider this week all of your schedule and determine if there are any changes you want to make, as when I was in college, I didn't think as intentionally as I might have liked to do about all the possibilities. If this is you, I don't want you to think you're alone. 

Taking a business ethics class is crucial for people looking to better understand the ways in which decision making and our beliefs get challenged, tested, and refined in the workplace, as a consumer, or as a business owner. Especially for those who claim a Christian worldview, a class like this can help prepare future leaders to navigate the complex ethical challenges that arise in the business world. 

As Christians, we are called to love our neighbors, tell the truth, and seek to live our God’s love in the world. While you will see references to biblical principles such as the golden rule in this class, it is not intended to be a theology class. Instead, you will be invited to reflect on your values, which often will intersect with ones embedded throughout Christianity, broadly speaking. Recognizing that most of us will go on to work in professional contexts that require us to work with people who are different than us and who follow other faith traditions or belief systems, you're going to be asked to express your perspectives in such a way as to be understood by people who have diverse worldviews, including those who do not share a Christian faith. 

> I sent an email out to those who were registered for the class a while back, asking for you to reply to let me know why you're taking a class about business ethics. If you haven't done so, already, please email me and share your reasoning and what you hope to get out of the course. 

#### It's more important than sword fighting

When I first started working at Vanguard, I had my first teaching assistant (TA). His name was Brandon and he was about to graduate. To finish up his coursework, he needed units, but they could be in anything he wanted to take. I thought it was so cool that he got to take sword fighting[^4], even though he wasn't a theatre major and never set foot on the stage. The class would practice on the Heath lawn and sometimes I would catch glimpses of them out there, looking like they were having a blast. 

This may be controversial, but for most people (besides theatre majors), I'm going to go out on a limb and say that business ethics is more important than sword fighting. If you find this offensive, reach out to me. Let's talk. I'm open to being wrong on this one. Speaking of sword fighting, I don't think I can reference it without putting [a clip from of one of my favorite movies of all time: The Princess Bride][7]. 

!?[The Princess Bride movie clip - My Name is Inigo Montoya (1987)][8]

I'm pretty sure that Brandon never got as good as those actors in The Princess Bride at stage combat while at Vanguard, but he sure did brighten my days and I'm glad to have known him. I should probably get back to why someone may want to take a class about business ethics. 

#### You will have a guide for life

I realize that part about having a guide for life sounds pretty dramatic. But I truly believe that the more we understand about ethics, in general, and the context that most of us will spend a huge percentage of our lives (work), the more we will be able to bring more of God's love into the world. 

A definition seems in order right about now: 

> Business ethics are the principles that guide decision-making and are vital for transparency, inviting feedback, considering the impacts on employees, stakeholders, and society, and reflecting on past experiences. 

Most of us like to consider ourselves ethical people. However, without being aware of the contexts in which we may be faced with incredibly challenging decisions, ones for which there are not easy answers, we are likely to make a choice that may not align with our espoused values. Every year we seem to hear about a company involved in some sort of ethical scandal affecting workers, customers, society as a whole, or the environment. Watch [The Importance of Business Ethics][9] to explore this further. 

> The speaker in [The Importance of Business Ethics][10] discusses the importance of ethical behavior in business and the consequences of unethical actions. The video presents scenarios illustrating ethical dilemmas, cites examples of unethical corporate behavior, and emphasizes the negative impacts of a lack of ethics in organizations. Discover the significance of adhering to protected values and how ethical behavior can lead to improved employee morale, productivity, and long-term profitability, while recognizing how unethical actions can harm a company's reputation and investor confidence.

###### ? 00.01 | Review questions | The Importance of Business Ethics

> Here are some questions to test your understanding from watching the video. 

Volkswagen is mentioned for lying about emissions in the video.

[[X]] True
[[ ]()] False

According to the video, a company's relationship with investors has no impact on ethical standards.

[[ ]()] True
[[X]] False

The video suggests that employees with strong commitment to ethical values are more likely to report unethical behavior.

[[X]] True
[[ ]()] False

What does the video primarily discuss?

[[ ]()] Benefits of coffee consumption
[[X]] Ethical dilemmas in business
[[ ]()] The history of Starbucks
[[ ]()] Employee loyalty

According to the video, what is the quickest way to lose trust with employees?

[[ ]()] Demanding high ethical standards
[[X]] Lying to employees
[[ ]()] Offering fair trade products
[[ ]()]  Conducting experiments

What did the individuals in Wagner's experiment receive $5 for?

[[ ]()] Reporting ethical breaches
[[X]] Flipping tails four times
[[ ]()]  Lying to their employers
[[ ]()] Treating customers unethically

Ethical responsibilities extend to society by promoting sustainable practices and corporate social responsibility (CSR), which are increasingly expected by customers, employees, and investors. To customers, ethical responsibilities include avoiding misleading practices like greenwashing and false advertising. With innovations such as artificial intelligence and facial recognition technology, the number of ethical dilemmas in business is increasing. 

As new technologies emerge, their long-term impacts, both positive and negative, may not be apparent until they have been in use for some time, as seen with the effects of social media on children and teenagers[^5]. Ethical treatment of employees is also crucial, as fair practices contribute to a successful organizational culture, which can benefit the company economically and legally.

#### You're joining someone who finds utter joy in teaching and learning

Since the age of five, I knew what I was going to do for a living. I would have my stuffed animals and dolls set carfully out in my room, approximating a classroom. My mom had bought me materials from a local educational store. I had the books that my 'students' could use, as well as the 'teachers' edition, used to guide me in my pedagogy. My bedroom door had a sign hung on it, which read: Room 208. The name I used was Miss. Monroe, a testiment to the power of the 1970s version of the tv show Charlie's Angels' characters in my life at the time. 

When I was in college, picking a major was easy. I majored in social sciences, meaning I got to pick three of my favorite subjects to focus on: psychology, sociology, and history. I was certain that I would graduate with a single subject waiver to teach high school classes and would earn my teaching credential during what would have been my fifth year in college. I did graduate on time with a bachelors degree in social sciences, but my adventures in teaching have taken me plenty of places, but never inside a high school classroom. 

> I have always wanted to teach. 

Fast forward to today. I teach as a professor of business and management at Vanguard. I'm also dean of teaching and learning, which gives  me opportunities to collaborate with other faculty to improve all of our teaching and support efforts that allow students to thrive in their learning. My passion is in continually becoming more effective facilitating learning for students. I’m also fortunate to get to coach faculty and support them in my dean role. 

![Bonni podcasting][image-4]

Since June of 2014, I have been airing weekly podcast episodes of [Teaching in Higher Ed][25]. I started podcasting upon the urging of my husband, Dave, who I had met while earning my MA degree in Organizational Leadership. He had started the [Coaching for Leaders][26] podcast three years prior to his nudging for me to launch one. Given how much I enjoy talking about teaching and learning, I'm grateful for the ways in which those hundreds of conversations have shaped me all these years. 

I've been married to Dave since April of 2005. It took us many years and lots of medical interventions, but our two kids came into the world and have been surprising and delighting us ever since. One of my favorite things about being a parent is how infectious our son's and daughter's collective curiosity can be. 

If you would like to learn more about me, I have a fairly active presence online, including: 

- [Teaching in Higher Ed][27] - website with my weekly podcast episodes, rare blog posts, and speaking resources from when I'm invited to share at other universities or conferences about teaching and learning
- [LinkedIn][28] - professional connections and occasional reflection posts
- [Instagram][29] - personal connections and occasional pics of what I'm up to
- [BUSN435 Instagram][30] - an opportunity for us to experience #OpenEducation, to the extent we are comfortable to do so \~ this account is for our class, specifically 

![BUSN435 Instagram account, displaying a few sample quotes and the profile for the account][image-5]

#### If you show up for the work, you may just find your life transformed

![Dr. B holds a sign that reads: 'show up for the work'][image-6]

Those social media profiles that include a cover image as part of what we are invited to set up, I often post a picture of me, sitting in my Vanguard office, holding a sign that reads: 

> Show up for the work. 

This is inspiration taken from the life of Christian author Rachel Held Evans, who sadly passed away in her late 30s. Her legacy lives on, in terms of inviting us to think seriously about what we believe and be open to changing our minds. She had a sign hanging above her writing desk that said those same words, representative of her vulnerability in spending time and being in relationship with people who thought differently than she did about important issues in the world. 

You are also likely to notice that I enjoy laughing and having fun. As Christopher P. Long says:

> Joy is at the heart of all meaningful work.

My hope is that we'll take our character seriously and the call to love our neighbors, while not taking ourselves too seriously (leaving room for growth and humility). May I be a person who models that right along with each of you. May you take the radical step of deciding each week that you're going to show up for the work in this class. If we do that together, it's quite possible we could leave changed people.

**Go back to your Google slides now and continue there, until such point as it invites you back over for the next part.** 

### 00.02 | How this class works

Speaking of showing up for the work, that's something that's important for you to do in this class. Yet, the act of showing up might look quite different, depending on your unique context and preferences. This isn't an easy class (at least that's what I've been told), but it is one that provides radical flexibility, in terms of how and when you can show up. See the class syllabus for more about how the class is structured. 

#### Your story and our stories matter

Vanguard has used the Your Story Matters tagline for quite some time. Some people find it to be trite, but I've always really liked it. I suppose how you feel about it may depend on how sincere you believe someone to be when they say that to you. 

> Your story matters to me. 

I started teaching at Vanguard in 2004. You can imagine that I've met a lot of students in that time. To this day, I always get excited and nervous about a new class starting. As weird as this may sound, you matter to me, even though in some cases, we may not have ever met, yet. I am looking forward to getting to know you throughout this class. 

Individual stories are compelling. Something powerful happens when groups form and create collective stories together. In this class, I'm looking forward to when we become an 'us.' 

We are going to need to work together to find ways of exploring topics together, while respecting and honoring each other in the process. It is highly likely that we will have different perspectives, making it that much more important to acknowledge and affirm [the imago dei][31] in each of us. 

#### It takes a village, or at least some reliable tools

My first job out of college was working for a computer training company. I used to teach technology classes to business professionals and would often fall asleep with a thick book next to me, back when people used to read books to learn how to use a software application. Even today, I love technology enough to mark on my calendar when any Apple Keynotes will be held, such as at their annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). Dave, my husband, and I used to consider it a 'romantic' date before we were married to sit and watch the latest keynote from WWDC back in the day. 😂

I continue to find technology fascinating and marvel at both its positive and negative contributions to society and in business contexts. In this class, there is an essential set of technology tools that you'll need to use, in order to be successful.

In this class, we will each keep an account where we can share the learning from our class, engage with each other and build community.                                                                                                                                                                               | Medium     |

#### Ten lessons and challenges

You will notice a pattern in this class. Throughout the semester, we will all: 

- Learn stuff - by watching videos, reading text, talking to each other and people we connect with as a class, wrestling with case studies, checking our understanding through games and quizzes **\#seek**
- Do stuff - challenge ourselves to go beyond just learning something, but actually applying it in some way **\#sense**
- Share stuff - the best kind of learning is the kind that is done in community with others **\#share**

I know it is cliché, but you will get out of this class what you put into it. While I recognize that each of you has busy schedules and plenty of other priorities, I expect that you will invest not just time into this course, but also that you'll challenge yourself to make this a good ROI (return on investment) for the time and money spent such that you can be a part of it. Do the right thing by investing in yourself and others this semester. 

> "Brothers and sisters, do not be weary in doing what is right."
> 
> -- 2 Thessalonians 3:13

My commitment is the same right back to you. As you challenge yourself, I will be continuing to work to be effective at facilitating learning and helping us all to have fun and be compassionately challenged along the way.

Go back to your Google slides now and wrap up Lesson 00.** 



## 01. It's all personal (or is it?)

![Lesson 01 graphic][image-9]

I'll admit to often feeling more nervous than normal when teaching this class. The topics we explore together tend to sometimes bump up against aspects of our identity such that it feels far beyond the normal way we might approach learning in some other classes. 

> I want for us to take our commitment to being ethical people quite seriously, while not taking ourselves so seriously that we hinder the potential for growth. 

In terms of the importance of taking this class seriously, the following come to mind as crucial reasons to do so:

1. **Moral Integrity:** The study of ethics helps individuals and societies maintain moral integrity. It guides us in distinguishing right from wrong and encourages us to act in ways that align with our values and principles. This fosters trust, respect, and fairness in our interactions with others.

2. **Accountability:** Ethical principles provide a framework for holding individuals and institutions accountable for their actions. It ensures that those who engage in unethical behavior can be held responsible for their actions, leading to justice and fairness.

4. **Personal Growth:** Embracing ethics can lead to personal growth and development. It encourages self-reflection and self-improvement, helping individuals become more empathetic, compassionate, and considerate of others.


On the other hand, not taking ourselves too seriously is also important for several reasons:

1. **Humility:** Recognizing our own limitations and imperfections fosters humility. It allows us to learn from our mistakes and be open to different perspectives and ideas.

2. **Improved Relationships:** People are often drawn to those who have a sense of humor and can take things lightly. It can enhance our social connections and make us more approachable.

4. **Creativity:** A more relaxed attitude can promote creativity and innovation. When we're not overly focused on perfection, we may be more willing to take risks and explore new ideas.

Taking ethics seriously helps us maintain our moral compass, while not taking ourselves too seriously can lead to us being able to see how other may see things differently than we do. Balancing these two aspects is essential for leading a meaningful and fulfilling life. It is also a way we can experience greater growth throughout our time together in this course.  

![Image of a stop sign with a lizard sitting on top of it](https://innovatelearning.s3.amazonaws.com/stop-sign-with-lizard-on-top.png)

Go back to your Google slides now and return, when instructed to do so.**

### 01.00 | What does it mean to be ethical?

What does it mean to be ethical, especially in business? It's more than just knowing right from wrong; it's about understanding how our decisions impact others. I will be making some references to the show The Good Place in this class. While not set in a business context, The Good Place still offers us many lessons to draw from in business ethics. I won't ruin the ending for you, but will introduce some characters and plot points along the way. 

> "The Good Place" is a television show that features a unique blend of comedy, philosophy, and ethics. The show revolves around Eleanor Shellstrop, played by Kristen Bell, who wakes up in the afterlife and is told she has entered "The Good Place" due to her good deeds on Earth. However, Eleanor soon realizes that there has been a mistake, as she was not a virtuous person during her life. She teams up with other residents of The Good Place, including Chidi Anagonye (William Jackson Harper), Tahani Al-Jamil (Jameela Jamil), and Jason Mendoza (Manny Jacinto), to try and become a better person and earn her place in this supposed paradise.

In this first clip, we are going to hear about how points get assigned in the good place. Throughout each person's life, they earn and lose points with each good and bad choice. CW: There is a brief mention of suicide in this clip. 

---

!?[How Afterlife Points are Assigned - The Good Place][35]



How do points get assigned in the good place?

[[X]] By people doing good things and not doing bad things
[[ ]()] By ensuring that there are fair outcomes for the powerful
[[ ]()] The points get assigned in the neutral place, not the good place
[[ ]()] By humans following the legal regulations where they live



You will continue to see clips show up from The Good Place in this course. It is a thought-provoking show that raises important ethical and philosophical questions. 

---
#### It's more than just knowing right from wrong

Being ethical is more than deciding what is right or wrong. It requires navigating ambiguity, understanding context, and considering how decisions affect others. In business, ethical questions rarely have clear-cut answers.

Business ethics goes beyond a simple binary because:

- **Context and culture matter**: What is ethical can vary across cultures and situations.
- **Trade-offs are common**: Many decisions involve competing values, such as profit versus employee well-being.
- **Judgments are subjective**: People bring different values, experiences, and perspectives to ethical questions.
- **Legal isn’t always ethical**: Laws set minimum standards, but ethical responsibility often goes further.
- **Stakeholder interests conflict**: Ethical decisions must balance the needs of employees, customers, shareholders, and communities.
- **Standards evolve**: Societal expectations change, requiring ongoing reflection and adaptation.
- **Leadership requires moral courage**: Ethical leaders must make difficult choices with integrity and transparency.

Together, these factors show why ethics in business is about thoughtful judgment, not simple rule-following.

---

#### Shall We Play a Game?

I’ve created a game to help you practice distinguishing between **legal vs. illegal** and **ethical vs. unethical** actions, since that tends to be a topic that has been confusing for students in this class in the past. 

[Play the game][39], and take a screenshot at the end, showing your total points. The game will begin by letting you choose who you want to play as... and the goal doesn't necessarily have to be to get the highest score.

#### Moving Beyond Right and Wrong

Let's look at an example in a fictional story, but one that is relatable in a real worldF context. In the first Zootopia movie, Judy Hopps (a rabbit police officer) is trying to solve a missing mammals case. During a press conference, she makes an unintentionally insensitive comment about predators. Nick Wilde, a fox and her unlikely partner, takes offense and confronts her about it.

!?[Zootopia clip: Judy Hopps at a press conference][41]

This scene demonstrates how business ethics can move beyond simply right or wrong. Misunderstandings can so easily arise, even with good intentions. While this story is fictional, these kinds of misunderstandings and opportunities for our biases to negatively impact us our relationships happen all the time in a business context. 



Why is business ethics more than just a binary understanding of right and wrong?

[[ ]()] Because it only applies to cultural contexts
[[ ]()] Because it solely relies on legal regulations
[[X]] Because it involves navigating moral ambiguity and considering how decisions affect others
[[ ]()] Because it is entirely objective



Business ethics is a multidimensional field that requires individuals and organizations to navigate complex ethical terrain. It involves considering diverse perspectives, weighing competing values, and making principled decisions that align with one's values and the expectations of society. Recognizing the presence of grey areas in business ethics underscores the need for critical thinking, ethical reasoning, and continuous reflection on ethical principles in the corporate world.



###### ? 01.00 | Review questions | What does it mean to be ethical?



While something may be legal, it can still be considered unethical, highlighting the distinction between legality and ethics.

[[X]] True
[[ ]()] False



What is the significance of recognizing ethical grey areas in business?

[[ ]()] It simplifies decision-making
[[ ]()] It eliminates the need for critical thinking
[[X]] It highlights the need for ethical reasoning and reflection on values and principles
[[ ]()] It ensures compliance with laws and regulations



### 01.01 | Let's get personal
I’m going to ask you to bring your whole self into this class, applying what you’re learning through your own experiences, values, and context. We’ll have fun together, but we will also take seriously our responsibility to love our neighbors. Some of the topics we explore may challenge our identities and cultural perspectives, and that’s part of the work.

#### **Imago Dei as our foundation**

A central concept guiding our time together is *Imago Dei*—Latin for “image of God.” Rooted in Genesis 1:27, it affirms that every person is created with inherent dignity and worth. This belief shapes how we approach ethics and values in a business context.

Keeping *Imago Dei* at the center means:

- **Honoring human dignity** by rejecting exploitation, discrimination, and unjust treatment.
- **Guiding ethical decisions** with integrity, honesty, and care for others.
- **Practicing compassion and empathy** toward employees, customers, and communities.
- **Embracing social responsibility** through stewardship, sustainability, and community engagement.
- **Approaching conflict thoughtfully**, seeking justice, reconciliation, and respect.
- **Living with accountability**, recognizing responsibility beyond legal compliance.

Together, *Imago Dei* calls us to see business ethics not as rule-following, but as a commitment to honoring the full humanity of everyone affected by our decisions.



What is the meaning of Imago Dei?

[[X]] All are created in the image of God
[[ ]()] Turn the other cheek
[[ ]()] The golden rule - Do unto others, as you would have them to unto you

---

#### **It’s (often) not personal**

In this class—and in business—I’ll ask you to practice not taking things personally, or at least to give one another the benefit of the doubt. This shared commitment helps us communicate more effectively and maintain healthy relationships, especially when discussing ethics and other potentially polarizing topics.

One helpful frame comes from *The Four Agreements* by Don Miguel Ruiz, particularly the idea *Don’t take anything personally*. Ruiz reminds us that people’s words and reactions usually reflect their own experiences, values, and perspectives—not a judgment of you. Each of us is the “main character” in our own story, interpreting the world through our own lens. He writes: 

>  Nothing others do is because of you. What others say and do is a projection of their own reality, their own dream. When you are immune to the opinions and actions of others, you won't be the victim of needless suffering. --Don Miguel Ruiz

When conversations get charged, it helps to remember that strong reactions often say more about someone’s lived experience than about your intent or character. Holding this perspective creates a space that is both **safe and brave**—one where we can learn, disagree, make mistakes, and grow.

Not taking things personally supports two essential ethical capacities:

- **Empathy:** It helps us listen, learn from missteps, and avoid defensiveness.
- **Cultural humility:** It allows us to receive feedback, recognize the limits of our perspective, and continue learning across differences.

This mindset supports meaningful dialogue, ethical growth, and respectful engagement—inside and outside the classroom.

----



Not taking things personally means ignoring feedback or avoiding difficult conversations.

[[ ]()] True
[[X]] False



According to this agreement, strong reactions during ethical discussions are most often:

[[ ]()] A personal attack on your character
[[ ]()] A sign the discussion should stop
[[X]] A reflection of the other person’s experiences and values
[[ ]()] Proof that there is one correct ethical answer



[The Four Agreements][55] teaches us that not taking things personally is crucial for our emotional well-being and growth, especially when studying ethics or engaging in discussions on polarizing topics. Agreeing to not take anything personally allows us to recognize that others' reactions are often a reflection of their own reality and that by maintaining this perspective, we can develop empathy, cultural humility, and engage in meaningful dialogues for personal and collective growth.

---
#### Let's hold each other accountable

None of what I am describing here is easy. Having Imago Dei at the foundation of how we treat others and agreeing not to take things personally are two of the most challenging ways to approach engaging with other human beings. Let's embrace personal and interpersonal accountability as a means toward striving to embody these two principles. 

> Accountability is the responsibility and obligation of individuals and organizations to answer for their actions, decisions, and outcomes, especially in relation to ethical conduct.

Establishing and maintaining that type of accountability with each other will be worth it, because of the growth made possible when learning in that kind of community. In this next section, we will explore a few ways we can work to accomplish that together and to create the kind of community that will foster the highest trust and deepest learning opportunities. 

###### ? 01.01 | Review questions | Let's get personal

According to the text, why is it important not to take things personally during discussions on polarizing topics?

[[ ]()] To avoid all kinds of discussions
[[X]] To maintain healthy relationships and effective communication
[[ ]()] To prove others wrong
[[ ]()] To assert your personal beliefs

What does "Imago Dei" mean?

[[ ]()] Image of Man
[[X]] Image of God
[[ ]()] Image of Nature
[[ ]()] Image of Money

According to Don Miguel Ruiz, what does he say about others' actions and words?

[[X]] They reflect their own reality and dream
[[ ]()] They are a direct attack on your character
[[ ]()] They have nothing to do with them
[[ ]()] They are meant to hurt you


Inherent Human Dignity, as related to Imago Dei, emphasizes:

[[ ]()] The superiority of certain individuals
[[X]] The intrinsic worth and dignity of every human being
[[ ]()] Discrimination in business
[[ ]()] Exploitation of employees

What does the term cultural humility refer to?

[[X]] Recognizing the limitations of one's cultural perspective
[[ ]()] Being proud of one's own culture
[[ ]()] Ignoring other cultures
[[ ]()] Promoting cultural superiority

### 01.02 | Develop emotional intelligence

Throughout this class we are going to be working on developing and cultivating emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence (EI) refers to the ability to recognize, understand, manage, and effectively use one's own emotions and those of others. It is a crucial skill in both personal and professional contexts, including business. Strengthen your emotional intelligence by understanding and managing your own emotions. Recognize that not everything is a personal attack or criticism. Practice empathy and try to understand the motivations and emotions of others in the situation. This allows you to respond thoughtfully rather than react emotionally.

In this short Inside Out movie clip, the character of Joy realizes the value of core memories. It is vital for us to be able to recognize our emotions and to attempt to understand and empathize with others' feelings. 

!?[Inside out clip: Joy reflects on the value of core memories][71]

In order to explore the topics in this class, recognizing the varying perspectives we will inevitably have, emotional intelligence is going to be crucial. The key elements of emotional intelligence are: 

1. **Self-Awareness:** This involves recognizing and understanding one's own emotions, strengths, weaknesses, and values. It helps individuals assess how their emotions impact their actions and decisions.

2. **Self-Regulation:** Self-regulation is the ability to control and manage one's emotions, especially in high-pressure situations. It includes impulse control, adaptability, and emotional resilience.

3. **Motivation:** Motivated individuals set and work toward goals, even in the face of challenges. They often have a strong sense of purpose and can delay gratification.

4. **Empathy:** Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of others. It involves active listening, being attuned to non-verbal cues, and demonstrating compassion.

5. **Social Skills:** Effective interpersonal skills, including communication, conflict resolution, and collaboration, are essential for building positive relationships and achieving common goals.

Emotional intelligence is crucial in the business world. As I consider people I consider to be both successful and ethical, they exude those core foundations of emotional intelligence, while being humble enough to identify areas where they have fallen short. Emphasis has tended to historically focused on an individual's intelligence quotient (IQ), while in more recent years, businesses have began to stress the value of a person's emotional quotient (EQ) for various reasons:

1. **Leadership:** Leaders with high EQ can inspire and motivate their teams, leading to increased productivity and employee satisfaction. Daniel Goleman is a primary figure who has emphasized the importance of EQ in leadership.

2. **Teamwork:** EI fosters better teamwork and collaboration. Understanding and respecting diverse perspectives within a team can lead to innovative solutions and better decision-making.

3. **Customer Relations:** Employees with high EQ are better equipped to handle customer interactions, resolving issues effectively and providing exceptional service.

4. **Conflict Resolution:** EQ helps in resolving conflicts diplomatically, reducing workplace tension, and maintaining a harmonious work environment.



Which element of emotional intelligence involves effective interpersonal skills?

[[ ]()] Self-Regulation
[[ ]()] Self-Awareness
[[X]] Social Skills
[[ ]()] Motivation



By applying emotional intelligence in our workplaces, organizations can navigate cultural nuances successfully, foster trust, and achieve business success in increasingly diverse cultural environments. Developing emotional intelligence involves acknowledging and resolving these inner conflicts to make more informed and balanced choices. By implementing these strategies, individuals can minimize the tendency to take things personally, promote healthy communication, and build trust within a business context (as well as in our class' learning community).

### 01.03 | Clarify and Seek Understanding

When faced with a potentially offensive or unclear statement, don't immediately assume negative intent. Instead, ask for clarification or seek to understand the speaker's perspective. This proactive approach can prevent misunderstandings and build trust by demonstrating your willingness to engage in open and honest communication.

> Dialogue cannot exist in the absence of a profound love for the world and for people. The naming of the world, which is an act of creation and re-creation, is not possible if it is not infused with love. Love is at the same time the foundation of dialogue and dialogue itself.
> 
> -- Paulo Freire

Clarifying and seeking understanding is crucial for fostering productive dialogue, mutual learning, and establishing ethical practices. Here are some ways we can achieve this:

1. **Active Listening**: When discussing topics, both parties should practice active listening. This allows for a better understanding of each other's perspectives.
2. **Open Dialogue**: Encourage open and honest discussions with each other. 
3. **Feedback Loops**: Create mechanisms for feedback from me and from other students in the class, such that we can receive constructive feedback. This helps in ensuring that we have the opportunity to learn from each other.

In the following movie clip from the movie The Princess Bride, Vizzini, a character known for his intelligence, repeatedly uses the word "inconceivable" to describe unexpected events or situations. However, as the events become increasingly unusual, Inigo Montoya, one of his companions, becomes frustrated and points out, "You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means."

!?[The Princess Bride - Inconceivable clip][75]

Watching this exchange serves to reminder us all that effective communication requires not only speaking clearly but also seeking understanding and ensuring that the words used convey the intended meaning. It illustrates how misunderstandings can arise when individuals do not clarify or seek to understand the language and expressions used in communication. 

In the movie clip from "The Princess Bride," what does Inigo Montoya point out to Vizzini?

[[ ]()] Vizzini's excellent use of vocabulary
[[ ]()] Vizzini's impeccable timing
[[X]] Vizzini's misuse of the word "inconceivable"
[[ ]()] Vizzini's logical reasoning

Promoting understanding and inclusivity between business people and students taking a business ethics class is vital for fostering ethical business practices, cultural sensitivity, and productive dialogues. It benefits both parties and contributes to a more ethical and responsible business environment.

### 01.04 | Separate feedback from identity

Learn to separate feedback or criticism from your self-worth. Constructive feedback is often about the task or the situation at hand and not a judgment of your character. Remember that feedback is an opportunity for growth and improvement, not a personal attack. Here's an example of feedback in a business context, just not a real one. In "The Office," Jim gets a formal warning about how much time he spends goofing around. When in fact, the people giving him the feedback tend to be unable to process their feelings toward Jim or communicate with him in an otherwise healthy way. 

!?[The Office clip: Jim gets his review][79]

This scene serves as a reminder that feedback should be constructive, objective, and focused on job-related performance. When feedback becomes intertwined with personal comments, it can hinder professional growth and create discomfort in the workplace. Someone who stressed the idea of this type of separation was Steve Jobs, the former CEO of Apple. 

> *"The only way to do great work is to love what you do and to detach your ego from the outcome."* 
> 
> -- Steve Jobs

Separating feedback from our identity is vital for several reasons:

1. **Objective Self-Improvement**: When we detach feedback from our identity, we can view it more objectively. This allows us to focus on improving our actions, behaviors, or work without feeling personally attacked or defensive. It promotes a growth mindset, where we see feedback as a tool for personal development rather than a judgment of our worth.

2. **Effective Communication**: Feedback is meant to convey information about our actions or work. When feedback is tied to identity, it can lead to misunderstandings and defensive reactions. Detaching it from our identity makes it easier for both the giver and receiver to communicate effectively and ensure that the intended message is received.

3. **Reducing Emotional Impact**: Feedback that is closely tied to our identity can be emotionally taxing. It can lead to anxiety, stress, and a fear of failure. By separating feedback from our identity, we can reduce the emotional impact and maintain our mental well-being.



What is the main reason to separate feedback or criticism from one's self-worth?

[[ ]()] To prove that criticism is always wrong
[[ ]()] To avoid receiving any feedback
[[X]] To view feedback as an opportunity for growth and improvement
[[ ]()] To retaliate against those giving feedback



Yes, we recognize how important it is, but how do we do it? Here are some examples of how to separate feedback from our identity:

1. **Focus on Actions, Not Person**: When providing feedback, frame it in terms of actions, behaviors, or specific tasks rather than making it about the person. For example, say, "Your report lacks clarity in that section," instead of "You're not a good writer."

2. **Use the "I" Statement**: When receiving feedback, encourage the giver to use "I" statements. For instance, "When I was watching the presentation, I found myself getting confused in that part" instead of "Your presentation was confusing." This shifts the focus to the individual's perspective rather than making it a general judgment.

3. **Seek Clarification**: If feedback is vague or unclear, don't hesitate to ask for clarification. This allows you to better understand the specific areas that need improvement and prevents assumptions about your abilities.

5. **Practice Active Listening**: When receiving feedback, actively listen to the giver's perspective without immediately reacting emotionally. Take a moment to process the information before responding.

6. **Reflect on Feedback**: After receiving feedback, take some time to reflect on it. Consider whether it aligns with your goals and values. This can help you decide whether to incorporate the feedback into your actions or not.

7. **Separate Constructive from Destructive Feedback**: Learn to differentiate between constructive feedback (aimed at improvement) and destructive criticism (intended to harm or belittle). Focus on constructive feedback and disregard the latter. [^6]

8. **Maintain Self-Esteem**: Remember that feedback does not define your self-worth. You can be a valuable person regardless of any specific feedback you receive. I find it especially helpful to consider the person providing me with the feedback and whether or not they are a worthwhile source from which I can grow and develop.

Separating feedback from our identity is crucial for personal growth, effective communication, and emotional well-being. It allows us to learn from feedback without letting it define us.

### 01.05 | Be aware of cognitive dissonance

In order to develop emotional intelligence, it's crucial to be aware of cognitive dissonance, a psychological phenomenon where individuals experience discomfort due to conflicting beliefs or values. Watch this explainer from Concepts Unwrapped about Cognitive Dissonance: 

!?[Concepts Unwrapped - Cognitive dissonance video][83]

As shared in the video, cognitive dissonance is a psychological concept that refers to the discomfort or tension that arises when an individual holds two contradictory beliefs, attitudes, or values, or when their actions are inconsistent with their beliefs. This state of mental conflict can lead to feelings of discomfort and the desire to reduce or eliminate this dissonance. 

Cognitive dissonance is a psychological phenomenon that arises when an individual holds two contradictory beliefs, attitudes, or values, or when their actions are inconsistent with their beliefs.

[[X]] True
[[ ]()] False

Recognizing cognitive dissonance in a business context is crucial for several reasons:

1. **Decision-Making**: In business, leaders and employees make numerous decisions daily, and many of these decisions involve trade-offs and conflicting information. When individuals experience cognitive dissonance, it can cloud their judgment and lead to suboptimal decision-making.

2. **Employee Satisfaction and Engagement**: Employees may experience cognitive dissonance when their personal values or beliefs conflict with the actions or policies of their organization. This can result in decreased job satisfaction, disengagement, and even turnover.

3. **Consumer Behavior**: Understanding how cognitive dissonance influences consumer behavior is essential for businesses. Consumers often experience dissonance when they make a purchase that conflicts with their beliefs or when they are exposed to conflicting information in advertising. Recognizing and addressing this can impact customer loyalty and brand perception.

Our brains want things to make sense and will make every attempt to have that be the case, including when we experience cognitive dissonance. The ways people may attempt to reduce or eliminate cognitive dissonance include: 

1. **Changing Beliefs or Attitudes**: One way to reduce cognitive dissonance is by altering one's beliefs or attitudes to align with their actions. For instance, an employee might rationalize unethical behavior by changing their beliefs about the importance of ethical conduct in business.

2. **Seeking Information**: People often seek additional information or evidence that supports their actions or beliefs to reduce dissonance. In a business context, this can involve looking for data that justifies a particular decision or course of action.

3. **Selective Exposure**: Individuals may avoid information that contradicts their beliefs or actions, a phenomenon known as selective exposure. In business, this can manifest as ignoring negative feedback or avoiding dissenting opinions.

4. **Compromise**: Sometimes, individuals find a middle ground that allows them to reconcile conflicting beliefs or actions. In a business context, this might involve compromising on certain values to achieve a specific goal.

5. **Social Validation**: Seeking validation from peers or colleagues who share similar beliefs or actions can help reduce cognitive dissonance. In business, this can lead to groupthink or conformity within an organization.

Recognizing cognitive dissonance and its impact in a business context is essential for effective decision-making, employee satisfaction, and maintaining a positive corporate culture. Acknowledging diverse perspectives on how cognitive dissonance is experienced and resolved can lead to more comprehensive strategies for managing it in the workplace.

How can cognitive dissonance impact decision-making in business?

[[ ]()] It always leads to optimal decision-making
[[X]] It can cloud judgment and lead to suboptimal decisions
[[ ]()] It has no impact on decision-making
[[ ]()] It leads to immediate resolution of conflicts

This lesson has defined ethics and discussed its importance, emphasizing not taking things personally and placing the Imago Dei at the center of our engagement with other human beings. We explored how to develop emotional intelligence, foster an environment of empathy and understanding. Moreover, we have recognized the significance of separating feedback from identity, allowing us to grow without fear of judgment. Finally, we highlighted the critical need to be aware of cognitive dissonance, a powerful tool in aligning our actions with our ethical principles. As we reflect on these lessons, let us strive to embody these principles in our daily lives, creating a more compassionate and ethical world for ourselves and those around us.

Go back to your Google slides now and wrap up Lesson 01.** 



## 02. That seems really inappropriate (Get to know your favorite philosophers)

![Course header graphic - lesson 02][image-13]

Before we get to study applied business ethics (in the context of an organization or industry), it is important to establish a firm foundation. Let's first examine the ideas and philosophies of influential thinkers who have shaped ethical thought over centuries. 

> What are the fundamental principles that guide ethical decision-making in business? How do different philosophical perspectives offer unique insights into corporate responsibility, sustainability, and social justice? 

By getting to know these philosophers (and some associated ethical frameworks), we will gain a deeper understanding of the ethical complexities that arise in the business world and how to navigate them effectively. The good news is that we aren't going alone.

### 02.01 | Road trip: We're going to Harvard

![LEGO depiction of a road trip to Harvard University - a group of students about to hop in a VW bus][image-14]

*This image was created using artificial intelligence.*

Buckle up, as we are about to embark on a virtual road trip to the intellectual haven that is Harvard University! We will make a visit to see the brilliant [Michael Sandel][112] and his thought-provoking Justice course, which has been taken by more than 15,000 students[^7].

During our virtual visit, we'll also be meeting some of the biggest names in philosophy, like [Immanuel Kant][114], [John Stuart Mill][115], and [John Rawls][116]. These philosophers have left their intellectual mark all over the study of ethics, and we'll be exploring how they guide our moral compasses in the complex world of business.

We are going to be looking at the intriguing "Moral Side of Murder" lecture from Sandel's course. This isn't a murder mystery, but a journey into the ethical intricacies that make us question our deepest beliefs. 

As we travel (at least in our imaginations) to Harvard's campus and experience Sandel's excellent teaching style, which is modeled off of Socrates (another philosopher we'll be meeting), let's remember the following timeless wisdom from that very same philosopher: 

> "An unexamined life is not worth living."
> 
> -- Socrates

 Our trip to Harvard will guide us on a voyage of self-discovery, where we'll uncover the right path to ethical decision-making in the business world. 

### 02.02 | The moral side of murder and the case for cannibalism

Episode One of Sandel's Justice class considers how effectively utilitarianism helps us use utility for decision making and inquires as to whether it helps us arrive at the right answer. In the first half of his lecture, Michael Sandel presents a hypothetical scenario to his students: Would you kill one person to save the lives of five others? Is it the right thing to do? This scenario launches a discussion on moral reasoning and the complexity of making ethical decisions in extreme situations.

> If you had to choose between (1) killing one person to save the lives of five others and (2) doing nothing even though you knew that five people would die right before your eyes if you did nothing—what would you do?  What would be the right thing to do?

Yes, that sounds pretty heavy there. But Michael Sandel keeps the Harvard lecture hall laughing, as you will see in the video. One of the most memorable parts of this class for past students has been getting to see inside one of the largest lecture halls at Harvard and to see how the students there respond to his questions. 

In the second half of this thought-provoking video, Michael Sandel delves into the ethical principles of renowned utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Bentham. To bring Bentham into our minds in a memorable way, Sandel introduces a well-known nineteenth-century legal case that unfolds as a shipwrecked crew of four individuals faces an agonizing dilemma. After enduring nineteen days adrift at sea, the captain makes a morally complex decision – to sacrifice the life of the weakest member, a young cabin boy, to ensure the survival of the rest by consuming his blood and body. 

> Suppose you find yourself in a situation in which killing an innocent person is the only way to prevent many innocent people from dying. What’s the right thing to do? This question arose in The Queen v. Dudley and Stephens (1884), a famous English law case involving four men stranded in a lifeboat without food or water. How should we judge the action of Dudley and Stephens? Was it morally justified or morally wrong?

**Take notes on the videos as you watch under your Lesson 02 notes.** They don't need to be super detailed, but be sure to capture the main terms and names that he mentions, as well as a few things you #notice and #wonder as you watch. 1-2 pages should do it. Keep your notes in the same place that you established for this class in previous lessons.

###### ? 02.02 | Review questions | Justice lectures episodes 01 and 02

Test your understanding of the basics of the concepts Sandel brought up in this first and second lecture in his Justice series. It's better if you don't look up the answers on the internet, as this is supposed to challenge your brain (not your internet searching skills). If you get any question wrong, you can try, again, so do yourself (and your memory) a favor and allow the retrieval practice a chance to work.

We can learn a bit about this philosopher from the openly-licensed textbook [Introduction to Philosophy: Ethics][147] and the section on Immanuel Kant, where they share that: 

> Relative to most other philosophers, Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) was a late bloomer, publishing his first significant work, *The Critique of Pure Reason*, in 1781 at age 57. 

![Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) by Johann Gottlieb Becker via Wikimedia Commons. This work is in the public domain.][image-15]

> Some of the main questions that Kant’s ethics focuses on are questions of right and wrong: What makes an action right or wrong? Which actions are we required by morality to perform? Do consequences matter? Is it ever permissible to do something morally wrong in order to achieve good consequences? Is it important to do actions with good intentions? And what are good intentions? Some of Kant’s answers to some of these questions are complex, but as we will see, he doesn’t think that consequences matter and thus good consequences cannot justify wrong actions. He also thinks that intentions are important to the ethical evaluation of actions.

Let's get to know Immanuel Kant, by watching a short video from  [Three Minute Philosophy: Immanuel Kant][148].

### 02.04 | Get real with John Rawls, y'all!

Another philosopher we are definitely going to want to know is John Rawls, in our study of business ethics. John Rawls continues to this day to be influential in the field of political philosophy, particularly his theory of justice. Here are some key points that business ethics students should know about John Rawls:

1. **Theory of Justice:** John Rawls is most renowned for his theory of justice as fairness, which he presented in his book "A Theory of Justice" published in 1971. This theory provides a framework for understanding what constitutes a just and fair society.

2. **Original Position and Veil of Ignorance:** Rawls introduces the concept of the original position, a hypothetical state in which rational individuals make decisions about the principles of justice. These individuals are behind a "veil of ignorance," meaning they don't know their own personal attributes, such as their gender, race, social status, or wealth. This ensures that the principles of justice they choose are fair and impartial.

3. **Two Principles of Justice:** Rawls proposes two principles of justice that individuals in the original position would agree upon:
   2. **First Principle (Equal Basic Liberties):** This principle states that each person should have an equal right to the most extensive basic liberties that are compatible with similar liberties for all.
   3. **Second Principle (Difference Principle):** This principle allows for social and economic inequalities as long as they benefit the least advantaged members of society. In other words, inequalities should be structured to improve the situation of the most vulnerable.

4. **Maximin Principle:** Rawls advocates for a decision-making approach under conditions of uncertainty where one should prioritize maximizing the minimum level of well-being. In his theory of justice, this principle underlies the *Difference Principle*, which holds that social and economic inequalities are permissible only if they improve the position of the least advantaged in society.



True or False: Rawls' first principle of justice emphasizes equal basic liberties for all.

[[X]] True
[[ ]()] False

What is John Rawls most renowned for in the field of political philosophy?

[[ ]()] Theory of Equality
[[X]] Theory of Justice as Fairness
[[ ]()] Theory of Wealth
[[ ]()] Theory of Liberty

According to Rawls, what are the two principles of justice that individuals in the original position would agree upon?

[[ ]()] Equal Basic Liberties and Maximum Wealth
[[ ]()] Equal Opportunities and Wealth Redistribution
[[X]] Equal Basic Liberties and Difference Principle
[[ ]()] Equal Opportunities and Social Hierarchy



It is time to further explore what John Rawls called the veil of ignorance. The Veil of Ignorance is a device for helping people more fairly envision a fair society (or business) by pretending that they are ignorant of their personal circumstances. Watch [this short video from Ethics Defined about the veil of ignorance][164]. 

!?[Veil of ignorance | Ethics defined][165]

> And fairness, as Rawls and many others believe, is the essence of justice. 



In a business context, we can apply Rawls' ideas to ethical dilemmas. Rawls' emphasis on fairness, equal opportunities, and addressing the needs of the least advantaged can inform decisions business leaders make regarding corporate social responsibility, fair wages, and ethical business practices. There are critiques and debates surrounding Rawls' theory, including criticisms of the feasibility of implementing his principles in the real world and concerns about the balance between individual liberty and social equality. This takes us back to the grey areas of studying ethics. John Rawls' theory of justice provides a foundational framework for thinking about fairness and ethical decision-making in society, including its relevance to business practices and corporate ethics. Understanding Rawls' ideas can help us engage in discussions about ethical dilemmas in the business world from a broader philosophical perspective.

### 02.05 | Aristotle meets Batman

Ready to meet our last philosopher? Well, at least for this lesson? Aristotle, an ancient Greek philosopher, laid the groundwork for virtue ethics, a philosophical approach that has enduring relevance in the field of business ethics. His profound insights into human nature and ethics continue to guide individuals and organizations in making ethical decisions. Aristotle believed that the ultimate purpose of human life is to achieve eudaimonia, often translated as "happiness" or "flourishing." Virtue ethics, as expounded by Aristotle, centers on the development of virtuous character traits as a means to attain this state of well-being. 

> Virtue Ethics is a normative philosophical approach that urges people to live a moral life by cultivating virtuous habits.
> 
> -- Ethics Unwrapped from McCombs School of Business at the University of Texas

A cornerstone of Aristotle's virtue ethics is the idea of virtues and the golden mean. Virtues, such as courage, honesty, and justice, are character traits that contribute to both individual and societal well-being. Aristotle proposed that virtues lie between two extremes, with the golden mean representing the balanced and virtuous path. For example, courage is the space between recklessness and cowardice. Watch [this short video from McCombs School of Business Ethics Unwrapped][175] to explore more about virtue ethics. 

!?[Virtue ethics | Ethics defined][176]

Virtue ethics is all about living a morally upright life through character development. This approach suggests that practicing virtues like honesty, bravery, and generosity leads to a virtuous character. Aristotle believed that these virtuous habits help individuals make ethical choices when faced with dilemmas. In the clip, we learn how to clarify the differences between moral philosophies, by considering the film The Dark Knight. Utilitarians might support Batman killing the Joker to save others, while deontologists would reject it solely because killing is wrong. In contrast, virtue ethicists focus on Batman's character, asking if he wants to become someone who takes lives. The answer is usually no. Virtue ethics teaches us how to be virtuous individuals and provides guidance for ethical living without rigid rules for specific dilemmas we might face.

![Image of a stop sign with a lizard sitting on top of it][image-16]

\*\*Go back to your Google slides now and wrap up Lesson 2.

## 03. Decide how we decide when we decide

![Course lesson graphic 01][image-17]

When I was earning my doctorate, one of our professors would regularly emphasize the importance of deciding how we were going to decide something as a group, before we actually made any specific decision. As easy as that may sound, we weren't always very disciplined about doing it and conflict or group confusion would arise, because of us not having determined our process, in advance. 

> We are going through a case study that will help us think about how we might make a decision, in the case where it wasn't obvious what the right thing to do was. This helps us surface the values and frameworks we might use in a business context to make ethical decisions. 

If you haven't finished the case study, yet, head over to that part of Lesson 03, before you continue further. Otherwise, we might not have as authentic of responses from you for that part. 

### 03.01 | Ethical frameworks

Let's start with why everyone hates moral philosophy professors, or otherwise getting us to laugh a bit to warm up our brains to discover more about ethical frameworks. In this clip, The Good Place Channel does a mashup of two tv shows, both of which focus on philosophy: 

!?[Philosophy according to Jack and Chidi - The Good Place and AP Bio's mashup][192]

Ethical frameworks are systems of moral principles or guidelines that help individuals and organizations make ethical decisions and evaluate the moral implications of their actions. These frameworks provide a structured approach to navigating complex ethical dilemmas by offering a set of principles, rules, or perspectives to consider when facing moral choices.

You explored some of the ethical frameworks, as you were going through the case study. Several ethical frameworks exist, each with its own principles and approaches to ethical decision making. Let's explore some examples of ethical frameworks

#### Consequentialism: Weighing actions by their outcomes

This framework asserts that the morality of an action is determined by its outcomes or consequences. Let's look at an example of a company who took a look at the outcomes of their decisions and the resulting impacts on the plant. 

> Patagonia, an outdoor apparel and gear company, decided to shift its entire product line to use recycled materials, emphasizing environmental sustainability. This decision was made in line with their consequentialist approach, focusing on the positive outcomes for the planet.

!?[What's next? | Patagonia][193]

> Patagonia's commitment to using recycled materials led to reduced environmental impact, increased brand loyalty among environmentally-conscious consumers, and positive financial results. The company's decision aligned with consequentialist ethics, as it resulted in both ecological benefits and improved profitability.

**Utilitarianism**, a specific form of consequentialism, emphasizes maximizing overall happiness or minimizing suffering. Individuals following consequentialist ethics will consider the potential consequences of their actions and choose the course of action that results in the greatest good for the greatest number.

Of course, businesses haven't always been focused on attaining good outcomes for stakeholders, or the planet. Let's look at a less-than-ideal consequentialist decision making approach, from the company Enron. 

> Enron, once a leading energy company, engaged in unethical accounting practices to inflate its financial statements, a decision driven by a consequentialist approach aimed at maximizing shareholder value.

!?[Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room movie trailer][194]

> The consequentialist pursuit of immediate profits through fraudulent accounting eventually led to the collapse of Enron. Thousands of employees lost their jobs and life savings, and investors suffered significant financial losses. Enron's unethical actions, driven by a narrow focus on short-term gains, had catastrophic consequences for all stakeholders involved.

These examples illustrate how consequentialist decision-making in business can result in both positive and negative outcomes, depending on the ethical considerations and long-term consequences taken into account.

#### Deontology: The moral compass of duties and principles

Deontological ethics focuses on the inherent nature of actions rather than their outcomes. It emphasizes adherence to moral rules or duties, irrespective of the consequences. **Immanuel Kant's categorical imperative** is a well-known deontological approach that encourages individuals to act according to principles that could be universally applied without contradiction.

> In the early 1980s, Johnson & Johnson faced a severe crisis when some bottles of their Tylenol product were tampered with, resulting in multiple deaths. The company's decision to recall all Tylenol products from store shelves and redesign packaging to prevent tampering aligns with deontological ethics.

Let's explore more from one of the textbooks we are drawing on for this class: [Introduction to Philosophy: Ethics chapter on Kantian Deontology][195]: 

> One of the distinctive features of Kant’s ethics is that it focuses on duties, defined by right and wrong. Right and wrong (which are the primary deontic categories, along with obligatory, optional, supererogatory, and others) are distinct from good and bad (which are value categories) in that they directly prescribe actions: right actions are ones we ought to do (are morally required to do) and wrong actions we ought not to do (are morally forbidden from doing). This style of ethics is referred to as deontology. The name comes from the Greek word *deon*, meaning duty or obligation. In deontology, the deontic categories are primary, while value determinations are derived from them. 
> 
> Kant believes all our duties can be derived from the categorical imperative... 
> 
> First, Kant believes that morality must be rational. He models his morality on science, which seeks to discover universal laws that govern the natural world. Similarly, morality will be a system of universal rules that govern action. In Kant’s view, as we will see, right action is ultimately a rational action. As an ethics of duty, Kant believes that ethics consists of commands about what we ought to do. The word “imperative” in his categorical imperative means a command or order. However, unlike most other commands, which usually come from some authority, these commands come from within, from our own reason. Still, they function the same way: they are commands to do certain actions.
> 
> Kant distinguishes two types of imperatives: hypothetical and categorical imperatives. 
> 
> A hypothetical imperative is a contingent command. It’s conditional on a person’s wants, needs, or desires and normally comes in the following form: “If you want/need A, then you ought to do B.” For example, the advice, “If you want to do well on a test, then you should study a lot” would be a hypothetical imperative. The command that you study is contingent on your desire to do well on the test. Other examples are, “If you are thirsty, drink water,” or “If you want to be in better shape, you should exercise.” Such commands are more like advice on how to accomplish our goals than moral rules. If you don’t have a particular want, desire, or goal, then a hypothetical imperative doesn’t apply. For example, if you don’t want to be in better shape, then the hypothetical imperative that you should exercise, doesn’t apply to you.
> 
> A genuinely moral imperative would not be contingent on wants, desires, or needs, and this is what is meant by a categorical imperative. A categorical imperative, instead of taking an if-then form, is an absolute command, such as, “Do A,” or “You ought to do A.” Examples of categorical imperatives would be “You shouldn’t kill,” “You ought to help those in need,” or “Don’t steal.” It doesn’t matter what your wants or goals are; you should follow a categorical imperative no matter what.
> 
> But these aren’t *the* categorical imperative. Kant believes that there is one categorical imperative that is the most important and that should guide all of our actions. This is the ultimate categorical imperative from which all other moral rules are derived. This categorical imperative can be expressed in several different ways, and Kant presents three formulations of it in *The Groundwork*.
> 
> #### THE FIRST FORMULATION OF THE CATEGORICAL IMPERATIVE
> 
> The underlying idea behind the first formulation of the categorical imperative is that moral rules are supposed to be universal laws. If we think of comparable laws, such as scientific laws like the law of gravitational attraction or Newton’s three laws of motion, they are universal and apply to all people equally, no matter who they are or what their needs are. If our moral rules are to be rational, then they should have the same form.
> 
> From this idea, Kant derives his first formulation of the categorical imperative, “act only in accordance with that maxim through which you can at the same time will that it become a universal law."
> 
> First, we must explain this word “maxim.” 
> 
> What Kant means by a maxim is a personal rule or a general principle that underlies a particular action. As rational beings, we don’t just act randomly; we devise certain rules that tell us what to do in different circumstances. A complete maxim will include three pieces: the action, the circumstances under which we do that action, and the purpose behind that action. For example, the maxim explaining why you’re reading this book, if it’s an assigned text, might be, “I will read all books assigned for class because I want to succeed in class.” Different principles could underlie the same action. For example, you might be reading this book simply to help you understand the topic, in which case your principle might be, “When I am confused about a topic, I will read an accessible text to improve my understanding.” The important point is that we are guided by general principles that we give to ourselves, that tell us what we’ll do in certain circumstances.
> 
> The first formulation, thus, is a test of whether any particular maxim should be followed or not. We test a maxim by universalizing it, that is, by asking if it would be possible for everyone to live by this maxim. If the maxim can be universalized, meaning that it’s possible that everyone could live by it, then it’s permissible to follow it. If it can’t be universalized, then it is impermissible to follow it. The logic of the universalization test is that any rule you follow should apply to everyone—there’s nothing special about you that allows you to be an exception.
> 
> To look at some examples, imagine you need money to pay off some debts. You go to a friend to borrow the money and tell this friend that you will pay him back. You know you won’t be able to pay your friend back, but you promise him nonetheless. You are making a false promise. Is this permissible? To test, we first look at the maxim underlying the action, something like, “If I need something, I’ll make a false promise in order to get what I need.” What would happen if everyone were to make false promises every time they needed something? False promises would be rampant, so rampant that promises would become meaningless; they would just be empty words. For this reason, the maxim can’t be universalized. The maxim included the idea of making a promise, but if, when universalized, promises cease to have any meaning, then we couldn’t really make a promise. Since the maxim can’t be universalized, we shouldn’t follow it, and thus we derive the duty to not make false promises.
> 
> We should note that Kant’s universalization test is not asking whether universalizing a maxim would lead to undesirable consequences. Kant is not claiming that making a false promise is wrong because we wouldn’t want to live in a world where no one kept their promises. It’s wrong because it’s not possible to universalize the maxim. It’s not possible because it leads to a contradiction. In this case, the contradiction is in the concept of a promise: that it becomes meaningless when universalized. We can see this with other maxims. If you’re thinking of stealing something, the maxim underlying this action might be something like, “I’ll steal the things I want so I can have what I want.” If everyone were to follow this maxim, then the concept of ownership would cease to have any meaning, and if nothing were owned, then how would it be possible to steal? To steal means to take someone else’s property without permission, and this is where the contradiction comes in. It’s not possible to steal if nothing belongs to anyone. Thus, it’s not possible to universalize this maxim, and we thereby get the duty that we shouldn’t steal. Both of these contradictions are what Kant calls “contradictions in conception.”
> 
> Another example Kant gives is of our obligation to help out others. Suppose you could help people but didn’t want to. Your maxim might be, “I will never help out anyone else since everyone should be independent.” If this were universalized, then everyone would be completely independent, with no one asking for, nor offering help. However, we wouldn’t be able to live in a world where no one helps anyone because we’ll inevitably sometimes need others’ help. The contradiction in this case is a practical contradiction, “a contradiction in will,” as Kant calls it. In this case, we would eventually have to break the maxim due to our need for help. Thus, from this, we get the duty that we should sometimes help out others in need.

!?[Managing the Tylenol crisis][196]

> Johnson & Johnson's decision reflects the principles of Kant's Categorical Imperative, particularly the principle of treating individuals as ends in themselves, not as means to an end. By prioritizing customer safety over short-term profit, the company demonstrated a commitment to ethical duty and the well-being of its consumers. Johnson & Johnson's ethical response to the Tylenol crisis not only saved lives but also enhanced their reputation as a responsible and trustworthy company. While the short-term financial cost was significant, their deontological approach led to long-term benefits in terms of customer trust and brand loyalty.

While Johnson & Johnson can celebrate the choices they made to support a trustworthy brand, other companies have not faired so well and have not acted in accordance to their values. 

> VW faced a scandal when it was revealed that they had intentionally installed software in their diesel vehicles to manipulate emissions test results, prioritizing short-term profits over environmental and regulatory obligations.

!?[Volkswagen's emissions scandal: A timeline][197]

> VW's actions in the emissions scandal directly contradict Kant's Categorical Imperative. They treated regulators and consumers merely as means to achieve financial gain, disregarding their moral duty to act honestly and ethically. Kant's principle of universalizability suggests that VW's actions would lead to a world where companies routinely deceive regulators and customers, undermining trust in the industry. The scandal resulted in substantial fines, lawsuits, and damage to VW's reputation. The company's deontological violation of ethical principles not only harmed its brand but also raised questions about corporate responsibility and trust in the automotive industry.

These contrasting examples serve as vivid illustrations of the profound impact ethical frameworks can have on business decisions. While Johnson & Johnson's deontological commitment to consumer safety, as exemplified in their response to the Tylenol crisis, showcased the enduring importance of moral duty and the Kantian Categorical Imperative, Volkswagen's transgressions revealed the devastating consequences of forsaking ethical principles for short-term gains.

#### Virtue Ethics: Cultivating excellence in character

Virtue ethics places importance on the development of virtuous character traits. It suggests that ethical behavior arises from cultivating virtues like honesty, courage, compassion, and integrity. Instead of following strict rules, individuals using this framework strive to embody virtuous qualities. 

> The Body Shop, a cosmetics and skincare company, has long been committed to ethical and environmentally responsible practices. They prioritize sourcing natural ingredients sustainably and supporting fair trade. This aligns with the virtue ethics approach, emphasizing virtues like environmental stewardship and social responsibility.

!?[At 40, The Body Shop becomes most ethical, sustainable global business][198]

> The Body Shop's dedication to virtue ethics has led to a positive brand image, increased customer loyalty, and a reputation for promoting ethical and sustainable business practices. Their commitment to virtues such as integrity, compassion, and environmental consciousness has not only been good for their bottom line but has also made a positive impact on the world.

On an entirely different side of the equation, Wells Fargo faced a scandal when it was revealed that the bank had created millions of fake accounts for customers without their consent, driven by a culture that prioritized aggressive sales targets and short-term profits over ethical virtues.

!?[How high up did the Wells Fargo fake accounts go?][199]

> The unethical behavior at Wells Fargo had severe consequences, including significant financial penalties, damage to the bank's reputation, and the loss of customer trust. This incident serves as a stark reminder that even established organizations can falter when they lose sight of virtue ethics and prioritize profits over integrity and customer well-being.

In the realm of business ethics, virtue ethics stands as a beacon of principled conduct, emphasizing the cultivation of virtuous character traits and ethical values. The Body Shop's unwavering commitment to sustainability and fair trade practices exemplifies how virtue ethics can lead to a positive and enduring impact, fostering trust and loyalty among consumers. Conversely, the Wells Fargo scandal serves as a cautionary tale, illustrating the perils of abandoning virtue ethics for short-term gains. Just as superheroes in the movies often uphold moral virtues to protect the greater good, businesses that prioritize ethical virtues create lasting legacies, while those that falter risk facing their own moral reckoning.

#### Rights-Based Ethics: Upholding fundamental human rights

Rights-based ethics, often associated with the work of philosophers like **John Locke** and **John Stuart Mill**, emphasizes individual rights and freedoms. It asserts that ethical actions are those that respect and protect the rights of individuals, such as the right to life, liberty, and property. 

> Ben & Jerry's, an ice cream company, has long been an advocate for social justice and sustainability. They prioritize supporting various social causes, including fair labor practices and environmental responsibility. This aligns with rights-based ethics, which places a strong emphasis on respecting and upholding the rights of individuals and communities.

!?[How Ben & Jerry’s Activism Helps Scoop Up Customers][200]

> Ben & Jerry's commitment to rights-based ethics has not only cultivated a loyal customer base but has also created a positive impact on society. They actively support fair labor practices, ethical sourcing of ingredients, and community engagement, reflecting their dedication to respecting the rights of workers, farmers, and consumers. Their success demonstrates how adhering to rights-based ethics can lead to both profitability and social progress.

Let's contrast Ben & Jerry's commitment to rights-based ethics to the contrasting case of Nike. While Ben & Jerry's has exemplified how upholding the rights and well-being of workers and communities can foster a positive brand image and drive social progress, the story of Nike underscores the repercussions a company can face when neglecting these fundamental rights. 

> Nike faced significant controversy in the 1990s when reports revealed poor working conditions and low wages in overseas factories where their products were manufactured. The company's prioritization of cost reduction and profit maximization over the rights and well-being of factory workers conflicted with rights-based ethics. 
> 
> Nike's violation of rights-based ethics led to widespread protests, boycotts, and damage to its reputation. The negative consequences, including public outrage and legal challenges, served as a stark reminder that disregarding the rights of workers can have severe repercussions for businesses.

The clothes we wear pose an opportunity for human rights violations to occur, as the Nike example shows. An undercover BBC investigation uncovered a distressing reality. Syrian refugee children were found laboring in Turkish factories, producing clothing for prominent British retailers, including Marks and Spencer and online giant ASOS. While these brands assert their strong stance against exploitation and child labor, this report sheds light on the complex issues surrounding labor rights and ethical responsibility within the global supply chain. This disconcerting revelation echoes the concerns raised in the case of Nike's past labor controversies.

!?[Undercover: The refugees who make our clothes - BBC][201] 

When it comes to business ethics, the lens of rights-based ethics remains a powerful guide, emphasizing the importance of respecting and upholding the fundamental rights of individuals and communities. Ben & Jerry's commitment to social justice and sustainability showcases how adhering to rights-based ethics can not only foster customer loyalty but also drive positive change in society. 

Conversely, Nike's past missteps and the fast fashion industry as a whole underscore the enduring impact of disregarding workers' rights, serving as a cautionary tale for businesses that prioritize profit over ethical responsibility. Just as iconic heroes in literature and cinema champion justice and individual rights, businesses that embrace rights-based ethics have the potential to make a lasting, positive impact on the world while safeguarding their own moral integrity.



#### Social Contract Theory: Navigating morality in collective agreements

This ethical framework, popularized by thinkers like **Thomas Hobbes** and **Jean-Jacques Rousseau**, posits that ethical norms and rules emerge from social agreements and contracts. It emphasizes the importance of following agreed-upon rules for the stability and well-being of society.

> Starbucks has a longstanding commitment to social responsibility and sustainability. They prioritize fair trade practices, ethical sourcing, and community engagement, aligning with the principles of social contract theory. By respecting the implicit social contract between businesses and society, Starbucks has fostered a positive reputation and customer loyalty.

!?[Follow Starbucks 15 Year Journey to 100% Ethically Sourced Coffee][202]

> Starbucks' dedication to social contract theory has led to a positive impact on both their brand and the communities they serve. They actively contribute to the well-being of coffee farmers, support local initiatives, and engage in environmentally friendly practices. This commitment has not only boosted their bottom line but has also solidified their role as a responsible corporate citizen.

One thing careful observers will notice about the Starbucks video is that it was produced by their own media people. While there is nothing wrong with promoting your values as a company to the public (and I do enjoy iced tea from Starbucks on a regular basis), I did a bit more digging and found this [rating for the Starbucks Corporation on the Ethical Consumer website.][203], which didn't place them in as positive of a light. The Ethical Consumer is a UK-based non-profit research, political, and advocacy-oriented publisher which rates companies on their ethical and environmental behavior. 

Let's just say not everyone is going to praise Starbucks for their adherence to social contract theory and environmental and social consciousness. For now, I'm going to keep drinking my iced teas, while also recognizing when I make purchases, I'm voting with our family's finances about the degree to which I'm going to support what a given company does. These are not easy choices and we should all resist thinking in dichotomous ways. 

A company that has had their share of controversy regarding their business practices is Facebook, which was founded by Mark Zuckerberg. Facebook faced public backlash due to issues related to user data privacy and data breaches. Their actions, which disregarded user consent and the implicit social contract of trust, conflicted with the principles of social contract theory.

!?[How Cambridge Analytics exploited the Facebook data of millions][204]

> Facebook's disregard for the social contract through the Cambridge Analytics scandal and other data breaches have led to public outrage, government investigations, and a loss of user trust. The negative consequences, including legal repercussions and damage to the company's reputation, underscored the importance of respecting the trust and expectations inherent in the social contract between technology companies and their users.

Social contract theory serves as a guiding principle, highlighting the importance of honoring the unspoken agreements between businesses and society. Starbucks' espoused commitment to ethical practices and community engagement exemplifies how adhering to the principles of the social contract can lead to both business success and positive societal impact. Conversely, Facebook's lapses in data privacy and trust demonstrate the profound consequences of neglecting the social contract, serving as a cautionary tale for companies that overlook their responsibilities to their users and the broader community. Businesses that uphold the social contract have the potential to thrive while contributing to the greater good of the communities they serve.

### 03.02 | Why bother learning about ethical frameworks

Before the COVID pandemic hit the world in early 2020, I used to think that all the exercises used to consider ethical frameworks were too theoretical and not realistic enough. I remember while earning my graduate degrees being presented with fictitious cases involving being on a life boat with just two matches, a hot dog, and 22 cotton swabs and trying to determine who was going to get to live. 

I no longer believe that those cases were that far off. More than ever, I find it essential to recognize the ways in which we are using ethical frameworks to guide our decision making and when those values may be in conflict with other people we are collaborating with regarding a decision. Ethical frameworks are essential to learn about for several reasons.

**Guidance and structure for ethical decision making**

Ethical frameworks provide guidance and structure for evaluating ethical dilemmas and making consistent and principled decisions. For instance, when Apple Inc. faced the ethical dilemma of balancing user privacy with national security in the case of the San Bernardino terrorist attack, ethical frameworks helped them navigate the situation. Apple's decision to prioritize user privacy aligns with principles of individual rights, a key aspect of ethical frameworks.

**Consistency in ethical choices**

Ethical frameworks promote consistency in decision making, ensuring that organizations uphold their ethical values regardless of the situation. In the corporate world, companies like Patagonia consistently prioritize environmental sustainability in their business practices. This alignment with their values, guided by ethical principles, has resulted in long-term trust and loyalty from customers who appreciate their ethical stance.

**Clarity of values and principles**

Ethical frameworks help individuals and organizations clarify their core values and principles. For instance, when Johnson & Johnson faced the Tylenol tampering crisis in the 1980s, the company's swift and ethical response demonstrated their commitment to the safety and well-being of consumers. By recalling all Tylenol products and redesigning packaging for tamper resistance, Johnson & Johnson showcased their ethical values and commitment to customer safety. This crisis management strategy aligned with their principles and communicated their ethical stance clearly to the public.

**Accountability for actions**

Understanding ethical frameworks holds individuals and organizations accountable for their actions. A notable case is Enron, where corporate leaders engaged in unethical accounting practices. The Enron scandal led to legal consequences and ethical discussions, highlighting the importance of accountability in the business world.

**Promotion of critical thinking**

Ethical frameworks encourage critical thinking by requiring individuals to consider multiple perspectives. In the film "12 Angry Men," jurors are faced with the ethical dilemma of a murder trial. Through rigorous debate and examination of evidence, they employ ethical reasoning to arrive at a just verdict. This scene of Juror #3 breaking down and pronouncing his decision of "not guilty," illustrates the ways in which ethical frameworks promote critical thinking in decision making and how one person can courageously challenge the status quo.

!?[12 angry men movie clip][217]

It's easy for us to think that if we were faced with the same situation, we would stick to our beliefs. However, there's overwhelming evidence that humans are susceptible to bring influenced by others in ways we aren't always conscious of... 

Consider the lessons from the [Asch conformity experiment][218], which was actually a series of experiments in which the psychologist Soloman Asch would put a single person in a group of people who believed that the others in the group were also participating in the research, when only one person's response was being examined. Asch would test to see that if the others in the group were to all report what was clearly the wrong answer, if the subject would go along with the others. 

!?[Asch Experiment - Conformity][219]As we learn more about ethical frameworks and how to put them into practice in our own lives, they can serve as valuable tools for navigating the complexities of moral decision making. They help individuals and organizations make ethical choices that align with their values, principles, and societal expectations. Understanding these frameworks enhances moral reasoning and promotes ethical behavior in various personal, professional, and societal contexts.

###### ? 03.02 | Review questions | Ethical frameworks and importance

## 04. Let's not get duped (or pass our ignorance onto others)

![Course lesson graphic 04][image-18]

It's not fun to look foolish. Yet it's easy to be tricked, given the state of where most of us get our information today: online.

I don't mean to sound offensive in saying the part about sounding ignorant. We're all ignorant about lots of stuff. You should try talking to me sometime about sports, for example, if you want to find someone ignorant on that broad set of subjects. 

The goal is to become more educated about the stuff that is important to us and to know when we don't know enough about something to be a credible source (or even know how to spot a credible source). I also want you to be taken seriously in life. A big part of that comes down to being able to identify and communicate effectively about evidence that supports your assertions. 

**Meet a Mikey or maybe two?**

Consider the following (and notice if you can hear a voice associated with these words):

> He likes it. Hey, Mikey. 

If you say these words to someone around my age, they'll likely know exactly what you're talking about. However, since most of you (ok \~ all of you) are likely younger than me, here's what Mikey was famous for, back when I was a kid.

!?[Commercial for Life Cereal][238]

What ever happened to the guy who played Mikey in that commercial? They're sometimes known as urban legends. There was one about Mikey, back in the day. People would talk about how you never see him anymore. Where did Mikey go? Well, it turned out (or so people said) that he had died in the most tragic of ways. 

**It must have been the pop rocks.** 

People said it was some bad combination of pop rocks and Diet Coke. Or maybe just plain Coke? I may be getting my urban legends and actual science experiments (like the one with Mentos and Diet Coke, which really does work) confused. 

How would we have figured out if this was true back at that time? There wasn't an internet to go check. There were newspapers, limited by page and word counts and professional journalists and researcher assistants.

In order to help us be taken seriously and to navigate today's business news and media landscape, it's time to serve up the Starter Course from Mike Caulfield. 

### 04.01 | Introduction to SIFT

Mike Caulfield is a prominent educator and digital literacy expert known for his work on a framework to help all of us be taken seriously and to be more literate in evaluating information we find online. He's best known for the SIFT model, which is featured in his "Check, Please! Starter Course," which we are about to embark on together. Mike Caulfield has a rich background in education, having worked at various institutions as an educator and researcher. He's known for his expertise in digital literacy and information literacy. Over the years, Caulfield has developed and refined the SIFT model, which is a practical framework for verifying and assessing online information. His work has been influential in equipping individuals with the skills to navigate the vast sea of information on the internet.

**The SIFT Model:**

The SIFT model is a systematic approach to evaluating online information for accuracy and reliability. It stands for:

1. **Stop:** This step encourages individuals to pause before sharing or believing information they encounter online. It emphasizes the importance of not immediately accepting or rejecting information.

2. **Investigate the Source:** In this step, Caulfield emphasizes the need to evaluate the credibility of the source of information. He provides techniques for determining whether a source is trustworthy or not.

3. **Find Better Coverage:** Caulfield suggests that individuals should look for multiple sources and perspectives on a topic to gain a more comprehensive understanding. This step helps students avoid falling into the trap of confirmation bias.

4. **Trace Claims, Quotes, and Media:** The SIFT model advises students to trace the claims made in a piece of information back to their original sources. This helps in uncovering potential misinterpretations or distortions.

5. **Check for Previous Work:** In this step, Caulfield recommends searching for existing fact-checks or investigations on the information in question. This can save time and provide additional context.

Mike Caulfield's Check, Please! Starter Course likely incorporates these principles of the SIFT model to teach business ethics students how to critically assess the information they encounter in the context of ethical decision-making. By following the SIFT model, we can develop essential skills for separating reliable information from misinformation (stuff we unintentionally misunderstand something and then share online) or disinformation (stuff nefarious people try to get us to believe by deceiving us or otherwise causing us harm).

Mike Caulfield has developed a great course to get us up and running with SIFT. I'm going to be making use of a lot what he has shared in his [Check, Please! Starter Course][239], which he has made available under a Creative Commons license[^8]. As long as I attribute what I share to Mike's work and point people back to his Check, Please! Starter Course, we're good (ethically and legally speaking). 

Throughout this lesson of the course, I will quote block the sections written by and provided by Mike Caulfield, so you can tell it apart from what I'm sharing. Normally, this is how I quote other people, or make something stand out.

**Introduction to SIFT**

> This course will take you through the basics of quick source and claim-checking, and introduce you to our "four moves", a series of actions to take when encountering claims and sources on the web. 
> 
> These course materials can be used for self-study, as part of a formal course, or as a set of independent assignments to practice your skills.
> 
> The course is broken up into lessons, each of which can be completed in a single sitting. They take from 20 to 45 minutes, are composed of 5 to 15 pages, and include instruction and a series of exercises. While some exercises may seem repetitive, we recommend you complete them all, as the point is not just learning what fact-checking is, but building a fact-checking *habit*.
> 
> The first lesson is a bit longer than the rest, and will introduce you to our basic approach — the "four moves" and the acronym we use to remember them: SIFT. The lesson will take 40 minutes to complete, including all readings, activities, and videos.

**Vocabulary: claims, sources**

- For the purpose of this course, a **claim** is a statement that purports to express something about reality. "The U.S. landed a space craft on the moon in 1969" is a relatively simple claim that is true. "The moon landing of 1969 was fake." is a simple claim that is false. "The mission to land on the moon was driven by Cold War fear more than scientific curiosity" is a complex claim one can have a range of opinions on, but is still, for a given context, either a well-supported claim, a controversial claim, or a claim lacking any real support.
- A **source** is the place where a claim or other information can be found. This course is a source of information about disinformation. Most claims can be found in multiple sources. You might find information about the moon landing in the Wall Street Journal, a website like Gizmodo, a textbook, a research paper, or a video recording of astronauts talking about the mission.

#### **Play Bad News!**

This is back to being Dr. B, again, for the moment. The game that Mike Caulfield included in his SIFT course is unfortunately gone now. So, we're going to play a different game. It's called: Bad News. Your goal in the game is going to be to be unethical, while trying to grow your follower count and influence. The game creators explain the game and how it works:

**What is Bad News?** 

> In Bad News, you take on the role of fake news-monger. Drop all pretense of ethics and choose a path that builds your persona as an unscrupulous media magnate. But keep an eye on your ‘followers’ and ‘credibility’ meters. Your task is to get as many followers as you can while slowly building up fake credibility as a news site. But watch out: you lose if you tell obvious lies or disappoint your supporters!

**How does the game work?**

> The goal of the game is to expose the tactics and manipulation techniques that are used to mislead people and build up a following. Bad News works as a psychological “vaccine” against disinformation: playing it builds cognitive resistance against common forms of manipulation that you may encounter online.

While you are playing, remember that the goal is to be unethical in your approaches. The better you are at using the tactics that unethical people use to manipulate people online, the faster the game will go for you and the more followers you will acquire. 

When I (Dr. B) first started playing it, the game was taking forever, because I would tell it that I wasn't feeling super good about manipulating people this way... Until I went all in and just got ruthless and stopped caring about being ethical. Feel free to go fast through the game and just try to be as unscrupulous as you can, while growing your following and building credibility (though not in the most ethical of ways, of course, hence the premise of the game...).

![Bad News Website: From fake news to chaos! How bad are you? Get as many followers as you can. Words in brightly-colored squares: Lie, manipulate, destroy, obscure, ignore, attack][image-19]

**Are you ready to play a game?**

Play Bad News by [following this link][242]. 

Be sure to play all the way through the game, learning about the various ways that manipulation techniques can be used to mislead people. Techniques you'll be asked to get good at for the purposes of the game include: 

- Impersonation
- Emotion
- Polarization
- Conspiracy
- Discredit
- Trolling

**Make sure to take a screenshot of your final results for your notes.** If your score winds up being higher than 15.584, that means you did better than I did on my first play in January of 2025. Come back here to the reading, once you're done. 

**Start Lesson 04 notes**

Using whatever note-taking system you devised in the earlier lessons, start taking notes for Lesson 04. Include a reflection on what it was like to play the Bad News game and include the screenshot you took, previously. Begin taking notes on the problems with approaches to telling truth from lies online, many of which you probably have been advised to use, previously in your lives. 

Let's get back to Mike Caulfield's sharing... 


#### The problem with checklist approaches

> We've been doing research into why students fail to separate fact from fiction on the web.
> 
> What we've found? Students are bad at the web because they've been taught techniques that make them bad at it. And they've learned those those bad techniques from *teachers*.
> 
> Here's some things students often believe:
> 
> - They believe that .org's are more trustworthy than .com's.
> - They believe that a good looking layout and few typos mean something is trustworthy.
> - They think pages that have ads on them are less trustworthy than those that don't.
> - They think that footnotes automatically make a site credible.
> 
> These are only a few of the (very wrong) things students believe. Before you learn to read the web you may have to unlearn some of the stuff you've been taught.

**How CRAAP goes astray**

![A picture of the CRAAP method with 20+ questions.][image-20]

> Most instruction students get about reading the web is derived from a set of approaches called "checklist approaches".
> 
> Sometimes these approaches were presented as literal checklists. Above is a checklist for a methodology called CRAAP. (I'm not joking).
> 
> Sometimes they weren't checklists, but a set of "things to look for in a web page."
> 
> What the approaches had in common was this: you'd come to a webpage and look for signals that the page was trustworthy on the *page itself*. You'd ask questions like
> 
> - Does this look professional?
> - Are there spelling errors?
> - Is there scientific language?
> - Does it use footnotes?
> - The "checklist" idea? Students were told the more "good" things the page had the more "trustworthy" it was.
> 
> Except there are three problems with this approach. Big problems.

**Problem 1: The signals are meaningless**

![Picture of Word document with autocorrect][image-21])



> Most things people are told to look for? They're easy to fake. It's really cheap to get a good-looking site nowadays. You can be a disinformation agent from China or Russia and still use spell check. Anyone can add footnotes to make something look more serious (students do it all the time!) The same holds for using scientific language.
> 
> And a lot of things students are told to look for have no basis in reality at all. In our research we have found students believe
> 
> - .orgs are better than .coms (No.)
> - non-profits are better than for-profits (Wrong.)
> - less ads on a page means the page is more reliable (Not even close.)
> 
> To put it simply — the things that might mean something are easy to fake, and many things students are taught to look for don't mean anything at all.



**Review Questions**



A website that looks professional and well-designed is always more trustworthy than one that looks amateurish.

[[ ]()] True
[[X]] False



According to Caulfield, *students often believe* that websites with fewer ads are more reliable (even though this is not necessarily true).

[[T]] True
[[ ]()] False



Which of the following is NOT a reason Caulfield criticizes checklist-based website evaluation?

[[ ]()] Students tend to believe signals that have no basis in reality.
[[ ]()] Disinformation agents can easily fake professional-looking sites. 
[[X]] Checklist approaches prevent students from using any sources at all.
[[ ]()] The presence of scientific language or footnotes does not always mean reliability.



Why is looking for a **.org** domain not a reliable way to determine credibility?

[[ ]()] Only government websites use .org domains.
[[X]] Any organization can register a .org domain, including those spreading misinformation.
[[ ]()] .org websites must be run by universities or research institutions.
[[ ]()] .org domains guarantee that the information is fact-checked.



**Problem 2: The checklist processes take too long**

> Checklist processes were developed for students trying to decide which of a number of library resources to use for a paper. Given that time frame, such an approach might make sense. You can spend 20 minutes looking at each of three journal articles you found to see which would be the best fit for an end of term research project.
> 
> In 2019, however, our problem is not deciding between three half-decent library resources over the course of an afternoon. Instead we are forced to sift through hundreds of possible search results and social media posts to try and determine whether each is worth our attention or belief.
> 
> Take this TikTok video, for example. In it, one user has made a video that complains about the discontinuation of plastic straws out of what she sees as too high a level of concern about turtles. It's a bit meanly expressed, but that's her point. Another user posts a reaction — by 2050 there will be more plastic in the ocean than fish.

Note: Watch the video below. It is no longer stored on TikTok and instead is a copy of the video that was originally housed there. 

<iframe width="560px" height="800px" allowfullscreen="true" allow="autoplay *" title="duet with at beastmoder247 it is about more than just turtles savetheoceans" src="https://vanguard.instructuremedia.com/embed/a59c0eb3-77da-4741-90db-8b274b102b2b" frameborder="0"></iframe>

> It has literally taken me (Mike Caulfield) longer to explain this video than it takes you to watch it. But is the claim true? And what would happen if you had to engage in 20 minutes of investigation for every 10 second piece of content you viewed that made a claim?
> 
> Actually, we know what happens when students are given in-depth techniques to deal with the flood of content that reaches them — they don't use them. Without quick methods people decide to share content like this based on whether it seems believable, or worse, they just decide they can't trust anything at all.
> 
> The same is true with search. People use search to inform themselves about a variety of professional and civic issues. They search because they need to get information on a specific topic of pressing importance: how to safely change a tire, whether they should see a doctor about a rash, if the mayor's decision regarding panhandling will have a good or bad impact on the homelessness problem.
> 
> But the biggest gap is not whether they research deeply. It's whether they check at all. Take that factoid about plastic and 2050. If you could reliably check it in 60 seconds, you might. If not, you're either going to reject it or accept it without checking — mostly unconsciously. Without quick methods to search and sift, your "knowledge" about an issue will slowly become a mental shoebox of unverified scraps you heard here and there around the web.
> 
> While short methods may seem less rigorous, they are in fact better than long methods for many tasks. When I switch lanes while driving on the highway, I don't do a ten minute analysis of whether a car *might* be in the lane next to me. I check the mirror, do a head check, and change lanes. If my father had given me a ten minute lane-changing process when teaching me to drive, I wouldn't use it, and frequent accidents would just be a part of my life. This is the sort of thing you need for reading the web as well.



**Review Questions**



According to Mike Caulfield, why do most people **not** use in-depth checklist approaches when evaluating online information?

[[X]] They are too time-consuming for the fast pace of digital content / social media.
[[ ]()] They are not taught in schools.
[[ ]()] They only work for academic journal articles.
[[ ]()] They are difficult to understand.



What is the most **likely** outcome when people do not have quick methods for checking online claims?

[[ ]()] They carefully analyze each source they come across.
[[X]] They unconsciously accept or reject claims without verification.
[[ ]()]  They develop a structured research process before sharing information.
[[ ]()] They avoid using search engines and social media altogether.



**Problem 3: Using too many criteria results in stupid decisions**

> One popular idea is that checklists are important because they force students to evaluate dozens of criteria instead of just a few. But does evaluating more criteria result in better decisions? Many teachers say yes. The research says no.
> 
> The problem with having dozens of criteria is that many of them conflict. Readers then get overwhelmed, unsure to which ones they should pay the most attention.[^9] And that produces what I call the "sleazy car salesperson" effect.
> 
> Maybe you've had the good fortune to never have to deal with a car dealership. But the way it usually goes is this. You go in to get a car and you just want automatic braking, a rear camera, and satellite radio. What happens? Well, they've got a car that has all three, but it's also the luxury sedan and it's $8,000 more. You do get seat warmers and remote start, which are worth x hundred dollars, and the new side collision detection that's at least $1,000 as an after-market addition. Or you can get this other car that has two features but not the third, and if you add on the aftermarket cost it's less expensive than the luxury car, but you don't get that side collision detection, etc., etc. And... well, it's exhausting even to read that, right?
> 
> Car dealers set up cars this way intentionally, so that you can never weigh a couple factors in isolation, which leads to us being cognitively overwhelmed and making bad decisions. The effects of this sort of criteria overload are well-documented, going back decades. Yet methodologies like CRAAP set up processes in the same way.
> 
> On a pre-assessment we give to students, for example, we have students evaluate a statistical claim about firearm background checks. The sort of response we see repeatedly is, "Well, it's a .org so it's likely to be trustworthy, but it has an ad on the page so maybe not." It's this is "car lot" cognition. There's a tidal wave of conflicting signals so in the end we throw up our hands and say, "Who can know?"



**Review Questions** 



According to Caulfield, adding more evaluation criteria always improves decision-making.
[[ ]()] True
[[X]] False



The “sleazy car salesperson” effect refers to how students struggle with conflicting credibility signals, leading to confusion.

[[X]] True
[[ ]()] False



What is a major consequence of **overloading students** with checklist-based evaluation methods?

[[ ]()] They become more confident in their ability to verify online information.
[[ ]()] They develop a deep understanding of source credibility.
[[ ]()] They trust only government websites for reliable information.
[[X]] They often give up and decide that verifying information is impossible.



**Thank you, sir, may I have another**

We're back to Mike Caulfield's Check, Please! Starter Course and he's about to get to the main dish: SIFT. All these eating metaphors are making me hungry. 

#### Introducing SIFT

> So if long lists of things to think about only make things worse, how do we get better at sorting truth from fiction from everything in-between?
> 
> Our solution is to give students and others a short list of things to do when looking at a source, and hook each of those things to one or two highly effective web techniques. We call the "things to do" moves and there are four of them:

![Infographic showing the steps of SIFT: Stop, investigate the source, find trusted coverage, trace claims, quotes and media to the original context.][image-22]

**Stop**

> The first move is the simplest. **STOP** reminds you of two things.
> 
> First, when you first hit a page and start to read it — STOP. Ask yourself whether you know and trust the website or source of the information. If you don't, use the other moves to get a sense of what you're looking at. Don't read it or share it until you know what it is.
> 
> Second, after you begin the process and use the moves it can be too easy to go down a rabbit hole, chasing after more and more obscure facts or getting lost in a "click cycle". If you feel yourself getting overwhelmed in your fact-checking efforts, STOP and take a second to remind yourself what your goal is. Adjust your strategy if it isn't working. Make sure you approach the problem at the right amount of depth for your purpose.

**Investigate the source**

> We'll go more into this move in the next lesson. The key idea is to know what you're reading *before* you read it.
> 
> This doesn't mean you have to do a Pulitzer prize-winning investigation into a source before you engage with it. But if you're reading a piece on economics by a Nobel prize-winning economist, you should know that before you read it. Conversely, if you're watching a video on the many benefits of milk consumption that was put out by the dairy industry, you probably want to know that as well.
> 
> This doesn't mean the Nobel economist will always be right and that the dairy industry can't ever be trusted. But knowing the expertise and agenda of the source is crucial to your interpretation of what they say. Taking sixty seconds to figure out where it is from *before* reading will help you decide if it is worth your time, and if it is, help you to better understand its significance and trustworthiness.

**Find trusted coverage** 

> Sometimes you don't care about the particular article that reaches you. You care about the claim the article is making. You want to know if it is true or false. You want to know if it represents a consensus viewpoint, or if it is the subject of much disagreement.
> 
> In this case your best strategy is to ignore the source that reached you and look for other trusted reporting or analysis on the claim. In other words, if you receive an article that says koalas have just been declared extinct from the Save the Koalas Foundation, the winning strategy may be to open up a new tab and find the *best* source you can that covers this, or, just as importantly, scan multiple sources to see what the consensus seems to be. In these cases we encourage you to "find trusted coverage" that better suits your needs — more trusted, more in-depth, or maybe just more varied. We'll show you some techniques to do this sort of thing quickly.
> 
> Do you have to agree with the consensus? Absolutely not! But understanding the context and history of a claim will help you better evaluate it.

**Trace claims, quotes, and media back to the original context**

> A lot of things you find on the internet have been stripped of context. Maybe there's a video of a fight between two people. But what happened before that? Who started it? What was clipped out of the video and what stayed in? Maybe there's a picture that seems real but the caption is dubious at best. Maybe a claim is made about a new medical treatment supposedly based on a research paper — but you're not certain if the paper supports it.
> 
> In these cases we'll have you trace the claim, quote, or media back to the source, so you can see it in its original context and get a sense if the version you saw was accurately presented.

**It's about REcontextualizing**

> There's a theme that runs through all of these moves: it's about getting the necessary context to read, view, or listen effectively. And doing that *first*.
> 
> One piece of context is who the speaker or publisher is. What's their expertise? What's their agenda? What's their record of fairness or accuracy? So we investigate the source. Just as when you hear a rumor you want to know who the source of it is before reacting to it, when you encounter something on the web you need the same sort of context.

> When it comes to claims, a key piece of context includes whether they are broadly accepted or rejected or something in-between. By scanning for other coverage you can see the expert consensus on a claim, learn the history around it, and ultimately land on a better source.
> 
> Finally, when evidence is presented with a certain frame — whether a quote or a video or a scientific finding — sometimes it helps to reconstruct the original context in which the photo was taken or research claim made. It can look quite different in context!
> 
> In some cases these techniques will show you claims are outright wrong, or that sources are legitimately "bad actors" who are trying to deceive you. But even when material is not intentionally deceptive, the moves do something just as important: they reestablish the context that the web so often strips away, allowing for more fruitful engagement with all digital information.



**Vocabulary: bad actor, Pulitzer Prize**

- A person or organization that intentionally spreads misinformation, disinformation, or engages in deceptive practices online is a **bad actor**. 
- A **Pulitzer Prize** is a prestigious award given annually in the U.S. for excellence in journalism, literature, and musical composition



**Review Questions**



The goal of SIFT is to **quickly** determine the credibility of online content, not to spend excessive time fact-checking everything.

[[X]] True
[[ ]()] False



What is the **main purpose** of the **STOP** move in SIFT?

[[ ]()] To encourage fact-checking only after reading an article.
[[X]] To pause and evaluate whether you know and trust the source before engaging.
[[ ]()] To prevent people from reading anything on the internet.
[[ ]()] To make sure you verify information with at least three sources before continuing.



Why is **tracing claims, quotes, and media back to their original context** important?

[[X]] To make sure the content hasn’t been edited or misrepresented.
[[ ]()] To prove that social media is unreliable.
[[ ]()] To always find the first article that published the claim.
[[ ]()] To determine if a source is government-approved.



What **theme** runs through all four SIFT moves?
[[ ]()] Trusting only fact-checking websites for verification.
[[X]] Recontextualizing information to better understand its accuracy and meaning.
[[ ]()] Fact-checking every single sentence of an article.
[[ ]()] Avoiding online sources whenever possible.





**It's time to get those feelings out**

You are being introduced to some skills that will be new for most of you. It may start to seem like a lot, so it is time to keep capturing the learning in such a way as to be more memorable for you in the coming weeks and months. I've kept notes on SIFT and even continue sharing videos about my learning in a public way on the [Teaching in Higher Ed YouTube channel][273]. 

#### Your notebook

> Throughout this course you'll be asked both to do basic fact-checking activities and to think more deeply about the material presented. Here we introduce three things to help you with that.
> 
> We ask that you keep a notebook of your fact-checking exercises in a text editor or a word processor like Notepad, Google Docs, or Microsoft Word. If you are taking this as part of a class, you will periodically be asked to submit the contents of your fact-checking notebook for feedback from [your professor and others in the class]. 
> 
> The format of the notebook is simple. For each fact-checking assignment you will be given a heading. Write the heading in your document in all capital letters. Then hit enter and answer the questions you are asked to answer. Avoid any fancy formatting as you may have to post this in a format where the formatting will not carry over. 

At the very end of the course, you'll be asked to pick your favorite example from the notebook and to create a video, which will be shared with others in the class. Keeping links in your notebook will help save you time, later on, when you go to share your learning in a more public way.  

**Reflection prompts and vocabulary**

Reflection prompts are used to suggest questions for deeper exploration. Each time you see questions for reflection in the course, copy and paste them over to your notebook and include your reflections through a video or written response. 

**04.01: Reflection Questions**

Copy the following question over to your notes and reflect in writing or video with your answers. 

- Do you think media literacy could help some people avoid processes of radicalization? Or are the social drivers too strong?

- Are all conspiracy theories bad? Are all wrong? What do you think makes a conspiracy theory harmful? Do you hold beliefs that others would dismiss as conspiracy theory?
- Do you know anyone that has gone down the conspiracy rabbit hole on an issue? What have you learned from that experience about what drives conspiracy thinking?

**The Miseducation of Dylan Roof**

> Throughout this course, we'll be using a mixture of both weighty and trivial examples. Sometimes it may seem there's not much downside to being misinformed: who really cares if the "Alexa Voice-Activated Toilet" is real or Monster Brand Caffeinated Ham is fake?
> 
> But there are serious social implications to people not paying attention to where their information is coming from.
> 
> The video below primarily makes a point about Google. But given the facts presented here, is there a way that a lack of web literacy also played a role?

!?[Video: The miseducation of Dylann Roof][274] 



 **? 04.01 | Review questions | The miseducation of Dylann Roof** 



Dylann Roof was raised in a home that promoted white supremacist ideologies.

[[ ]()] True
[[X]] False



Roof’s radicalization began with a search for “black on White crime” on Google.

[[X]] True
[[ ]()] False



Google’s algorithm prioritizes content that is always trustworthy, reputable, and authoritative.

[[ ]()] True
[[X]] False



What organization’s materials did Roof encounter during his search?

[[ ]()] Ku Klux Klan

[[X]] Council of Conservative Citizens

[[ ]()] Southern Poverty Law Center

[[ ]()] Aryan Brotherhood



What event is associated with Dylann Roof’s radicalization?

[[ ]()] The Charlottesville rally

[[ ]()] The Tulsa race massacre

[[X]] The Emanuel A.M.E. Church massacre

[[ ]()] The Freedom Rides



Roof’s exposure to extremist content began when he typed a phrase into a [[Google]] search.



**How do people tend to get radicalized?** 

> One of the patterns we see in online radicalization — from Nazism to ISIS — is that people often begin their journey by discovering information on the web from extremists that shocks them. Usually they are unaware — initially — of the source of the information, and if they were aware of the source they might be more skeptical of the information presented. By the time they understand who is supplying the information and what their motives are, they are already aligned with those organizations' viewpoints.
> 
> Once a person starts down the conspiracy spiral, it's very hard to get back out. There is such a gap between what they see in "respected" sources and what they see from extremist sites that they come to believe the respected sites must be in on the conspiracy. And while in the past many people might hold one or two conspiracy theories, the hyper-connected, algorithmic nature of the internet creates a situation where believing in one conspiracy theory may lead to your exposure to more and more radical conspiracy theories.

**Questions for reflection**

Answer the following questions in writing or linked video in your notes. 

- Do you think media literacy could help some people avoid processes of radicalization? Or are the social drivers too strong?
- Are all conspiracy theories bad? Are all wrong? What do you think makes a conspiracy theory harmful? Do you hold beliefs that others would dismiss as conspiracy theory?
- Do you know anyone that has gone down the conspiracy rabbit hole on an issue? What have you learned from that experience about what drives conspiracy thinking?


#### Conclusion

> In this section you learned why some traditional approaches to online media literacy don't work, and were introduced to a new approach, encapsulated by the acronym SIFT. This approach favors "moves" rather than analysis, and encourages you to make quick checks before you read material.
> 
> Now that we have the basics down we will start practicing some of the web techniques that you can use to get quick answers as you "sift".

### 04.02 | Investigate the source

> One of the four "moves" is to "investigate the source". The following two short videos (less than four minutes) will introduce you to this move. As you'll see, we're not expecting people to do ground-breaking research, just to do some very quick checks.
> 
> The first (3:15) video shows how many of the things we think will make us better at the web — raw intelligence, critical thinking skill, familiarity with technology — don't necessarily help:

!?[Online Verification Skills - Video 1: Introductory Video][284]

> The second video (2:45) introduces you to our second move: investigate the source. (In case you forgot the first move already, the first move is "Stop")

!?[Online Verification Skills - Video 2: Investigate the Source][285]

As Mike Caulfield emphasizes in the Investigate the Source video: 

> "Do not look at what the organization says about itself. Look at what the web says about the organization. That's where you're going to find the truth of the matter."


#### Just add Wikipedia

> On the previous page you watched a video demonstrating the "Just add Wikipedia" technique. In that case we opened a new tab and fired up a search result page, typing a domain plus "Wikipedia" into the search box. In this next video, we show a variation of that technique that you can do in the omnibar of your browser (that part of the browser in which you can type a web location or a search phrase). We also show how this is particularly helpful for quick research on organizations.

!?[Just add Wikipedia (Source Verification Omnibar Hack)][286]

> Notice that while the most relevant Wikipedia article usually floats to the top of results, this is not always true. In the case of researching Nuclear Matters, the most informative Wikipedia page was the second result. When looking at *Before It's News* the first Wikipedia result that came up was the right one — but it was second in the Google results, after a result from Rational Wiki.

**Use Surprise as an Indicator**

> What do you look for on the Wikipedia page? It varies. Sometimes — as with the Nuclear Matters material in the video above — what sticks out most is the agenda of the group, e.g. something you thought was a research group turns out to be a political advocacy group with ties to the industry. Sometimes it's the fact that a source has a history of unreliability, as was the case with *Before It's News*. And many times (most, actually!) it will turn out the source just fine, as we saw above with the *SacBee* example.
> 
> But rather than a checklist of things to look for on the Wikipedia page, I want you to focus on two organizing questions:
> 
> - Is the site or organization I am researching what I thought it was?
> - If not, does it make it more or less trustworthy?
> 
> If you thought something was from a straight news site and it turns out to be from a conspiracy site, that should surprise you. And given your new knowledge, your initial impression of the trustworthiness should plummet. If you thought you were looking at a minor, unknown newspaper and it turns out to be a multi-award winning national newspaper of record, maybe your assessment of its trustworthiness increases. The effects on trust are of course contextual as well: a small local paper may be a great source for local news, but a lousy source for health advice or international politics.

**Vocabulary: paper of record, Op-Ed**

- A national **paper of record** is a reputable newspaper that attempts to cover all important national news with staff reporters. They are distinguished from regional and local papers which use staff primarily for local or regional news. 
- An **Op-Ed** (short for “opposite the editorial page”) is a written piece typically published in a newspaper or online news outlet that expresses the opinions or viewpoints of an individual not affiliated with the publication’s editorial board. Op-Eds are distinct from editorial articles, which reflect the collective opinion of the publication itself.
- **Editorials** are opinion articles that are representative of the perspectives of an entire editorial board. They are most often still thoroughly researches and are meant to reflect the organization's values as a whole. 

**Papers of Record**

The major papers of record in the United States and a few from outside the U.S. are included in the following table: 

| Paper of Record         | Country        | Best known for:                                                                                              |
| ----------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| The New York Times      | United States  | Known globally for its comprehensive reporting and influence, especially on U.S. and international politics. |
| The Wall Street Journal | United States  | Focused on business, finance, and economic reporting, with a strong reputation internationally.              |
| Financial Times         | United Kingdom | Recognized globally for its authoritative business and financial reporting.                                  |
| The Washington Post     | United States  | Distinguished for its investigative journalism, particularly on U.S. governance and political issues.        |
| The Guardian            | United Kingdom | Renowned for its investigative journalism, and wide-ranging international coverage.                          |
| La Monde                | France         | A leading French newspaper known for its thorough analysis of national and international affairs.            |
|                         |                |                                                                                                              |

When people get upset with large news organizations, like the listed papers of record, it is often not because of the journalistic/investigative practices, as a whole. Instead, we often can get upset by what is written in the opinion section of the newspaper. 

It is vital to be able to distinguish between news and opinion. Op-Eds are often written by experts, academics, public figures, or concerned citizens and aim to provide commentary on current events, social issues, or policy debates. Unlike news articles, Op-Eds are subjective and focus on persuasion or provoking thought.

Examples of Op-Eds:

1. A political analyst critiquing government policies on immigration reform.
2. An economist discussing the implications of rising inflation rates on global markets.
3. A climate scientist advocating for stronger environmental policies in response to climate change.
4. A community leader highlighting the importance of local education initiatives. 

Op-Eds are a vital part of public discourse, allowing for diverse viewpoints to be shared and debated. But they are not the same as traditional news articles or editorials. 

News articles from most major news organizations prioritize objectivity, accuracy, and balance, aiming to provide readers with fact-based reporting and multiple perspectives on a given topic. Journalists adhere to ethical standards like verifying sources, avoiding bias, and maintaining neutrality to ensure the information is credible and reliable.

Editorials, on the other hand, represent the collective opinion of the publication’s editorial board, often addressing key issues in a more unified voice. While editorials aim to influence public opinion, they still reflect the broader values of the organization and are grounded in thorough research.

In contrast, Op-Eds are individual viewpoints and do not reflect the stance of the publication itself. They allow for creative expression and persuasive rhetoric, often prioritizing a single perspective or argument. While Op-Ed writers are encouraged to base their arguments on evidence and logic, the tone and approach are typically more personal and subjective, distinguishing them from the impartiality expected in news reporting.



**Review Questions** 



When investigating a source, it is best to rely on what the organization says about itself.

[[ ]()] True
[[X]] False



The **“Just Add Wikipedia”** method helps quickly determine the background and reputation of a source.

[[X]] True
[[ ]()] False



 All Op-Eds are automatically unreliable because they contain opinions.

[[ ]()] True
[[X]] False



If a newspaper has an Op-Ed section with strong political opinions, it means that all of its news reporting is biased and is unlikely to follow standard journalistic practices. 

[[ ]()] True
[[X]] False



How is an **Op-Ed** different from an **editorial**?

[[X]] An Op-Ed represents an individual’s viewpoint, while an editorial reflects the opinion of the newspaper’s editorial board.
[[ ]()] Op-Eds only appear in online publications, while editorials are in print.
[[ ]()]  Editorials are personal opinion pieces, while Op-Eds focus only on neutral reporting.
[[ ]()] There is no real difference; they are interchangeable terms.



What is a **paper of record**?

[[ ]()] A newspaper that primarily reports celebrity gossip.
[[ ]()] A government-run newspaper that only publishes official statements.
[[X]]  A well-respected news outlet known for thorough and fact-based national reporting.
[[ ]()]  A news blog that publishes opinions and personal perspectives.



Let's get back to Mike Caulfield's SIFT framework and how important it is for us to know what we are looking at when we read a story, see a meme online, or get riled up by a social media post. 



#### What's important depends on context

> What you take note of when doing investigate the source searches will be highly dependent on how you initially interpreted the source.
> 
> As an example, I remember looking at a comment on Twitter from what I thought was an internet rando. He was talking about a historical point with a lot of confidence. I thought it was an interesting point, but not worthy of my attention. Out of habit I did a Wikipedia check on his name and found that he was a world renowned historian who had written the most popular textbook on the subject at hand. Surprise! I went back and read his comment more carefully and thought about it more deeply.
> 
> Conversely, I've occasionally seen newspapers on the web that seem to me (in the names and the way they look) like old established papers. Throwing their name into a *just add Wikipedia* search I find they don't have a Wikipedia page (odd if the paper is supposed to be a major paper) or that they were established less than two years ago. Neither of those outcomes means the paper is not to be trusted, but it might change the way I read it or prompt me to do more research.
> 
> Note that there can't be any hard and fast rule here — there's not a list of rules that says writing a textbook on the subject is good, not having a Wikipedia page is bad. But a lot of this is obvious in the specific case.
> 
> One caveat — some students, used to just reacting to claims, may not be forming conscious opinions of what a source is. If this is the case with you, take just the smallest fraction of a second to think about what you think you are looking at before you research it. Do you think this is a major news source? A local paper? A government database? A grassroots, people-powered movement? A professional organization? As we go through the course we'll talk more about some of these categories of sources.

**Vocabulary: grassroots, professional organization**

- **Grassroots organizations** are organizations which are primarily run and funded by interested citizens and independent activists.
- **Professional organizations** provide an array of services and support to people in a given field. An organization for electrical engineer may provide professional standards to follow, research on best practices, training for members, and lobbying for the field.

**SIFTing: Alexa-enabled toilet? (prompt)**

As Mike Caulfield instructs in the following, add the heading **SIFTing: Alexa-enabled Toilet** to your Lesson 04 notes for the class and prepare to take notes and begin your first SIFTing exercise. From Mike Caulfield:

> Each of our "Sifting" exercises will give you a scenario, show you a prompt associated with it, and ask you a question associated with it. You should "use your moves" on the prompt (the components of SIFT), then write your results in your notebook. If you are a student in a class, when you write your results in your notebook, make sure to use the specified heading, so that your professor knows what prompt you are responding to.
> 
> We start the course with some pretty light exercises. So here's your first exercise. A friend sends you a text about a new "Alexa Toilet":

![SMS message with text "Great, now there's an Alexa microphone in the bathroom too"][image-23]

Visit the [story on Tom's Guide about the Kohler Alexa toilet][297] and perform the activity described below: 

> Now we could use our "Find Trusted Coverage" move here. But let's hold off on that. The question I want you to investigate is:
> 
> - Is Tom's Guide a known product review site or something else?
> 
> Use the **Investigate the Source** move, find out what you can. In your notebook, write the heading ALEXA TOILET, hit enter and tell us what you found out.
> 
> When you are done, go to the next part to see how a fact-checker might approach this problem.

**SIFTing: Alexa toilet (discussion)**

> Here's an example of what a fact-checker might say:
> 
> **ALEXA TOILET**
> 
> According to Wikipedia, Tom's Guide is a publication run by the people who run Tom's Hardware, a very old and well known product review site. You can find this in the Wikipedia article on Tom's Hardware in the Related Publications section, and if you want to be super sure, click the linked footnote that talks more about the site and confirms this is the right URL for it. It seems like a trusted source for this kind of news.
> 
> How did we find that out? We used the Just add Wikipedia trick:

![GIF showing someone typing tomsguide.com wikipedia into their web browser and viewing some info about Tom's Hardware][image-24]

> We searched for the site (adding our bare keyword "wikipedia"), and found the most relevant Wikipedia page at the top of the results. It wasn't an exact match, but it was close enough to check it out.
> 
> Clicking through to the Wikipedia article Tom's Hardware, we searched (using either control or command-f) for the phrase Tom's Guide on the page, and found it in Related Publications.
> 
> This is probably enough to state it's a legitimate site for this sort of story, but if we wanted to be extra sure that the Tom's Guide mentioned here is tomsguide.com, there is a footnote on that part of the Wikipedia page, and if we follow it we find this:
> 
> **Los Angeles - September 18, 2007 - TG Publishing LLC (www.tgpublishing.net) a Bestofmedia Group company, one of the top-three online media publishing companies for technology in the world, announced today the rebrand of Gear Digest to Tom's Guide (www.tomsguide.com). Tom's Guide is the definitive online resource for unbiased and trusted information on the latest consumer electronics and technology gear.**
> 
> That's a press release from the group that runs Tom's Guide, so it might not be a great resource for some things, but for the purpose of confirming the URL is a match it's perfect. Less than sixty seconds of effort and we know this is a real site and likely a real story. Share the Alexa toilet story with anybody you desire.
> 
> Take a look at the answer in your notes. How did you do in your investigation? If you want to touch up your answer having read this, go ahead. 
> 
> Although not shown in the animation, we used "control-f" to search for information on the web page. If you are familiar with control-f (command-f on a Mac) continue on with the lesson. But if not, [watch this video on how to find a word on a web page with control-F][298] and [check out this article on using control-f on the web][299] — we'll be using it a lot.


#### Wikipedia

> Wikipedia is broadly misunderstood by faculty and students alike. While Wikipedia must be approached with caution, especially with articles that are covering contentious subjects or evolving events, it is often the best source to get a consensus viewpoint on a subject. Because the Wikipedia community has strict rules about sourcing facts to reliable sources, and because authors must adopt a neutral point of view, its articles are often the best available introduction to a subject on the web.
> 
> The focus on sourcing all claims has another beneficial effect. If you can find a claim expressed in a Wikipedia article, you can almost always follow the footnote on the claim to a reliable source. Scholars, reporters, and students can all benefit from using Wikipedia to quickly find authoritative sources for claims.
> 
> As an example, consider a situation where you need to source a claim that the Dallas 2016 police shooter was motivated by hatred of police officers. Wikipedia will summarize what is known about his motives and, more importantly, will source each claim, as follows:
> 
> Chief Brown said that Johnson, who was black, was upset about recent police shootings and the Black Lives Matter movement, and "stated he wanted to kill white people, especially white officers.[^10][^11]"  A friend and former coworker of Johnson's described him as "always [being] distrustful of the police.[^12]" Another former coworker said he seemed "very affected" by recent police shootings of black men.[^13] A friend said that Johnson had anger management problems and would repeatedly watch video of the 1991 beating of Rodney King by police officers.[^14]
> 
> Investigators found no ties between Johnson and international terrorist or domestic extremist groups.[^15]
> 
> Each footnote leads to a source that the community has deemed reliable. The article as a whole contains over 160 footnotes. If you are researching a complex question, starting with the resources and summaries provided by Wikipedia can give you a substantial running start on an issue.

If you want to know more about how credible we should consider Wikipedia, see: [Can We Trust Wikipedia? 1.4 Billion People Can't Be Wrong][305]. 

**SIFTing: Aligator (prompt)**

Check out both of these news reports and answer the questions below.

[Granddaughter of 90 year old woman killed by alligator sues West Ashley nursing home][306]

[90 Year Old woman killed by alligator at South Carolina nursing home][307]

**Questions**

- Are these trustworthy news sources for this sort of story?
- Is this story likely true?
- If you had to pick the best source of the two based just on what you found on Wikipedia, which one would you pick, and why?

**Alligator (discussion)**

> Here's one possible response:
> 
> Both these sources are real news sources according to Wikipedia. The alligator story is real. If I had to pick one of the two I would pick the first TV station (abcnews4) in this case because they are more local to the event (they are in Charleston, the city where it happened) vs. the KDVR story which seems to just be reprinting someone else's story (and is in Denver, not South Carolina!)
> 
> How do we get there? We start by doing our "just add wikipedia" trick. Let's show the ABC one first:

![GIF showing the ABC add wikipedia trick][image-25]

> We search the URL or domain and add our bare keyword "wikipedia". Selecting the most relevant search result we find it is about a local TV station in Charleston. Just to be sure the article is for the right site, we scroll down and make sure the URL matches. It does!
> 
> What about KDVR?

![GIF of typing https://KDVR.com wikipedia into Google browser search][image-26]

#### When are local sources good?

> Here's our first reflection: we often talk about authority being "contextual and constructed." Let's take that "contextual" piece. An organization that might have authority in one area, but won't have the same level of authority in all areas. For example, a fitness instructor might be a great person for advice on a fitness routine, but you wouldn't get medical advice from them. Likewise, you might ask your doctor about an illness or medical condition, but you wouldn't expect them to be an expert in aerobics.
> 
> Local and national newspapers employ reporters that have very similar skills, much more similar than fitness instructors and doctors. But even here authority differs depending on the type of story. For your first reflection, think of a sort of story where a local paper would have a high degree of authority. Then think of another sort of story where they might have far less authority.

**04.02a: Reflection Questions**

As usual, add these to your notes and answer them in writing, or video form. 

- For what sort of other stories might a local source be a particularly good authority?
- For what sort of other stories might a local source not be a good authority?

**SIFTing: Volcano plane (prompt)**

> Take a look at this story and answer the questions.

[Malaysia Airline flight forced into emergency landing][308]

**Questions**

- What sort of source is this?
- How do you know?

**Volcano plane (discussion)**

> Here's one possible response:
> 
> **World News Daily report is a satire site that by its own admission does not publish true stories. It's is also the source or a lot of hateful content. I found this out from Wikipedia — the Wikipedia article cited a large range of sources, from Buzzfeed to the Washington Post.**
> 
> How do we get there? We start by doing our "just add wikipedia" trick. Let's show the ABC one first:

![Search the URL and add Wikipedia][image-27]

> We search the URL or domain and add our bare keyword `wikipedia`. Selecting the most relevant search result we find it is a known satire site.

**A note about Buzzfeed**

> One thing you'll notice in the Wikipedia article is that Buzzfeed News is cited as source. Students are often confused by this, since they are most used to Buzzfeed being primarily a source of videos such as "I tried to eat five popular candies from Romania and this is what happened."
> 
> That Buzzfeed site isn't good news source for very much. It's not "fake", but it's not very serious. Years ago, however, Buzzfeed spun off a reliable, award winning news publication under the name "Buzzfeed News" (domain: www.buzzfeednews.com). And harkening back to our "contextual authority" discussion earlier, it turns out that Buzzfeed News has two of the top experts in the world on the "fake news" phenomenon. So when you see a link to Buzzfeed News on question about the trustworthiness of a site, it's well worth following.

#### The problem of fauxtire

> One problem — larger in the past, but still extant — is the problem of "fauxtire". Experts on disinformation use the term fauxtire to describe sites such as World News Daily Report which claimed to be satire sites (like the Onion) but in practice were not linked to because people thought they were funny but because people were fooled into thinking the stories were real.
> 
> This presents an interesting problem — if you run a site that is supposedly a humor site, but in practice it is convincing people of awful things, are you responsible for that? What if you intentionally tweak satirical headlines so they are more likely to deceive people (and hence make you more money from ads)?



**Vocabulary: satire, "fauxtire", local news**

- A form of humor or criticism that uses exaggeration, irony, or parody to comment on current events, politics, or society is known as **satire**. 
- Content that mimics satire but lacks clear comedic intent or exaggeration, often misleading audiences into believing false or deceptive information is sometimes called "**fauxtire**".
- **Local news** is journalism that focuses on events, issues, and stories relevant to a specific community, city, or region, often produced by smaller newspapers, TV stations, or online outlets. 





**04.02b: Reflection Questions**

Respond to the following in your notes.

- What are your feelings on fauxtire? Is it an ethical practice?
- Should companies like Facebook and Twitter downrank articles if they are being spread based on the impression they are "real" when they are not? What are the dangers of that?


#### Conclusion

> You finished lesson two! You've learned about one "move" (investigate the source) and one web technique associated with it ("just add wikipedia").
> 
> Next up we'll apply what you learned about investigating the source to a couple specific issues.

### 04.03 | Further investigation

> Let's put our investigate the source (the "I" in SIFT) move to use. We'll look into the problem of state-controlled media, and show you a variation of the "just add wikipedia" technique that you can use for individuals and organizations without websites.

**SIFTing: MH17 (prompt)**

> For this exercise, you'll need a bit of background. MH17 was a passenger plane shot down by Ukrainian separatists. Take one minute to watch this short video on the history of the crash.

!?[Video: Investigation finds MH17 was hit by a Russian-made missile][309]

> Looking only at issues around the source (and not the article itself), which of the following publishers is a better source on the downing of MH17 and why?

1. [Russians, Ukrainian to face murder charges over downing of Flight MH17][310]

2. [Video: Error message, video is not available in your country][311]

Spoiler alert. When Mike designed this exercise, that second video was available. However, since then, when trying to access the video, we get an error message saying that the video is not available in our country. You're probably guessing (correctly) that the first source (Reuters) is a better source to learn more about the downing of MH17 than Russian tv would have been. 

Pronunciation guide: 

?[How to say Reuters][312]

If we really wanted to see the video, we could make use of the [Internet Wayback Machine][313], but for now, I think it's ok to skip that extra step. Since you couldn't view the video, in all likelihood, just head over to Wikipedia and see what it has to share with us about RT.com. 

[RT (TV Network)][314]

You will learn more about the specifics related to the MH17 flight in the next section (discussion). 

**MH17 (discussion)**

> You probably noticed in the initial video evidence strongly suggests elements of the Russian government were involved with the downing of the flight, though the targeting of the passenger plane was likely a mistake.
> 
> Given this, it would be odd to trust RT on the issue, since the Wikipedia article on RT shows that RT (formerly *Russia Today*) is seen by many to be a propaganda tool of the Russian government.
> 
> How did we find that information? We started by doing our "just add wikipedia" trick. Let's show the Reuters one first:

![GIF showing the "just add wikipedia" moves in checking out Reuters.com][image-28]

> We search the URL or domain and add our bare keyword "wikipedia". Selecting the most relevant search result, we find Reuters is an international news organization. Scanning the article we note that there have been a few controversies related to timidity with climate change reporting and allegations of anti-Israel bias, but nothing that relates to this subject.
> 
> What about RT?

![An animated GIF showing the 'just add Wikipedia' moves in checking out rt.com][image-29]

> We do the same search for the URL or domain adding our bare keyword "wikipedia". As mentioned above, when we click through to the article we notice it is funded by the Russian government. Government funding is not necessarily bad, but scroll further we note that there are credible accusations it is a government propaganda outlet. In this case, read Reuters, a credible international news agency, and ditch RT.

#### Controversies on Wikipedia Pages

> One of the more difficult things for students is evaluating controversies on Wikipedia pages. Almost any paper of significant size and history will have controversies. So what counts? When scanning controversies quickly, it's worthwhile to look for a couple things.
> 
> First, is there evidence of outright deception or the embracing of conspiracy theories? Direct government influence? An agenda that is explicitly focused on propaganda? Things that are intentional or patterns of behavior mean more than ocassional error.
> 
> Second, if errors are noted are they related to the topic you are looking at? A paper that has published sloppy reporting on health claims, for example, might be okay on political news. And papers with biased opinion columns are often home to quality reporting. But if you are looking at a health claim and the controversies are around health, that may be a different story.
> 
> As always, stop and be strategic about your research — the question is usually whether a particular source good enough, or if there are enough questions around it that you should find better coverage. You don't have to prove RT lied about MH17, for example. 
> 
> **You just have to read enough of the Wikipedia page to realize you shouldn't be reading coverage from state-controlled media on this issue, especially since the state in question was likely involved in the event.**

#### Government manipulation of online media

> Russia is not alone in using influence to spread disinformation — many countries pursue such actions internally, and a number, like Russia and Iran, attempt to sow discord in other nations. Read the following (very short) article on state sponsored influence operations:

The original link that Mike had in his course is no longer available. Again, if crucial to our research, we could use the [Internet Wayback Machine][315] to locate it. However, in searching the present-day internet to find it, I did locate this related article that may help us discover more about why YouTube (which is owned by Google) would have blocked that last YouTube video from Mike's mini course.

[Facebook, Google and Twitter limit ads over Russia's invasion of Ukraine, by Shannon Bond][316]



**Vocabulary: Internet Wayback Machine, propoganda, Reuters, RT, conspiracy theories**

- The **Internet Wayback Machine** is an online archive that allows users to view past versions of websites, helping to track changes over time and recover deleted content.
- **Propaganda** is information, often biased or misleading, used to influence public opinion or promote a particular political, ideological, or organizational agenda.
- A global news agency, **Reuters** provides fact-based reporting on politics, business, and world events, with a reputation for accuracy and neutrality.
- A media organization that operates with government funding is considered **state-funded media**, but its journalistic integrity depends on factors like editorial independence and transparency.
- **RT** (formerly Russia Today) is a Russian state-funded media outlet that presents news and commentary from a Russian perspective, often criticized for spreading misinformation and propaganda.
- Often lacking credible evidence, **conspiracy theories** are alternative explanations for events that claim hidden or powerful forces are manipulating the truth.





**04.03: Reflection Questions**

Add the following to your notes and reflect on the questions. 

- What obligations do American companies have to prevent this sort of use of their platforms? 
- What responsibilities belong with the reader instead?



#### Expertise and reputation

> Evaluating expertise is hard. And we're not going to show you how to do that in any fine grained way.
> 
> But we will show you how to sanity-check expertise, to see if they are known to have expertise in their area or more pseudo than science, more salesperson than professional.

!?[Video: Mike Caulfield presents about expertise][317]

> The first example uses our "Just add Wikipedia" trick.  In the second example we show we used:
> 
> - Google News Search https://www.google.com/search?tbm=nws&source=hp&q=news+query+here&oq=
> - Google Scholar: https://scholar.google.com/

**SIFTing: Warming claims (prompt)**

> Here's an article by a guest author, Myles Allen, arguing that climate change is incredibly serious but that the way some activists are talking about the recent IPCC report (considered to be the scientific consensus on global warming) is at times alarmist. We are going down a very dangerous road if we don't act on climate change now, Allen agrees, but he also says the idea that most people will feel world-ending impacts in twelve years is not supported.

[The problem with claiming we have '12 years to climate breakdown, by Myles Allen in RealClear Science'][318]

> In this case, since Allen is not a reporter but instead presented as an expert. Check out his expertise by doing a Wikipedia search on his name. You'll have to use a bit of creativity here — but replace the domain name you've been searching on with his name.
> 
> Is he well qualified to write this article? Why or why not?
> 
> (Again, remember it's not about whether you think he is right or wrong here. We just want to know if his opinion here is worth considering and why.)

**Warming claims (discussion)**

> We check for Myles Allen in Wikipedia with the search `myles allen wikipedia`. There's a substantial chance he won't be in Wikipedia even if he *is* an expert, but it's a good first step to check there.
> 
> In this case, we luck out! He's in there:

![Animated GIF showing wikipedia search results for Myles Allen][image-30]

> Look at the Wikipedia article and then look (skim, really) his opinion piece. Does he have relevant expertise? Double check the answer in your fact-checking notebook and write down your assessment of the writer's expertise.



**04.03b: Reflection Questions**

- One of the understandings key to media literacy is "authority is constructed and contextual".  Different communities (scientists, reporters, politicians, psychologists, car mechanics) have different criteria for authority (constructed) and the type and level of authority you need may depend on your context (contextual).  What other types of expertise could this issue benefit from?



**SIFTing: Smoke-free (prompt)**

> Here's a summary of a report from an organization called Foundation for a Smoke-Free World. They want to eliminate smoking worldwide.

[Global Trends in Nicotine][319]

> For this example, do a Google News search on the foundation name. Is there anything in particular we should know about this organization before reading their materials? Describe what you found out and what sources you used in your fact-checking notebook. Use the heading SMOKE-FREE.

**Smoke-free (discussion)**

> In this case we use a Google News Search. There's multiple results, but we scan the little "keyword in context" blurbs to find relevant coverage.

![GIF showing the search for Foundation for a Smoke-Free World][image-31]

> We choose the source PRWatch. PRWatch isn't a perfect source — they've been accused at times of having an anti-corporate bias — but in general their reporting is well-sourced.
> 
> When we go to that article (or many of the other articles on that page) we find that there is some debate about whether the tobacco-industry funded Foundation for a Smoke-Free World should be seen as a research and advocacy organization. Part of that debate centers around its initial funding (it was founded with a large grant from the tobacco industry). But the critique of it from researchers is more subtle than that — they point out that the proportion of money spent on marketing to that spent on research is not indicative of a research organization. And you can see that some of those researchers [wrote that in a letter][320] to one of the more prestigious English-language health journals, the *Lancet*.
> 
> Even given all this, you might come to a conclusion that this organization is trustworthy, at least in some limited contexts. Or maybe not. But either way, it's crucial to know about the debate about this organization before you engage with (or share) its materials.

**Bias vs. Agenda**

> The above issue gets at an important distinction when looking at sources. Students often come to media literacy thinking that the primary thing they should be concerned about is bias. And since everyone has some form of bias, that ultimately leads to students thinking no one can really be trusted.
> 
> Personal bias has real impacts. But bias isn’t agenda, and it's agenda that should be your primary concern for quick checks.
> 
> Bias is about how people see things; agenda is about what a news or research organization is set up to *do*. A site that clearly marks opinion columns as opinion, employs dozens of fact-checkers, hires professional reporters, and takes care to be transparent about sources, methods, and conflicts of interest is less likely to be driven by political agenda than a site that does not do these things. And this holds true even if the reporters themselves may have personal bias. Good process and good culture goes a long way to mitigating personal bias.
> 
> You saw this in the introductory videos on the American College of Pediatricians. The main issue was not that the organization was biased, or even that was small (though this mattered somewhat). The main issue was that it didn't seem to be set up as a research or professional organization. It seemed, in fact, to be set up as a political advocacy organization.
> 
> Similarly, in this instance even though the tobacco industry has a long history of deception the researchers are not ruling out that it might be funding some good work. It's possible, even if suspicious.
> 
> What they are alleging is that the structure of the organization resembles a marketing organization more than a research organization, and that as such its research should be looked upon with some suspicion.
> 
> Again, you need to come to your own conclusion on whether that assessment is damning. But whether you agree with the researchers or not, adopt their approach. Ask first and foremost when approaching an organization or source "What is this group set up to do?"



**Vocabulary: bias, agenda**

- A **bias** in media or communication reflects a preference or inclination that affects how information is presented, sometimes subtly and unintentionally.
- **Agenda** refers to an underlying goal or motive that shapes the selection and framing of information, whether in media, politics, or advocacy.



While **bias** influences how someone interprets or presents information, an **agenda** actively drives what information is chosen or emphasized to achieve a specific outcome. A **bias** may be subconscious and result in unintentional slant, whereas an **agenda** is a deliberate effort to push a particular message or goal.



**Review Questions**



A **bias** is always intentional and meant to deceive audiences.

[[ ]()] True
[[X]] False



Bias and agenda are the same thing and can be used interchangeably.

[[ ]()] True
[[X]] False



A person or organization can have an **agenda** without having a **bias**.

[[ ]()] True
[[X]] False



What is an **agenda** in media or communication?

[[ ]()] A subconscious preference for certain viewpoints.
[[X]] A deliberate effort to push a particular message or goal.
[[ ]()] An objective approach to presenting all sides of an issue.
[[ ]()] A random selection of news stories based on audience preference.



What is the **main difference** between bias and agenda?

[[ ]()] Bias is always intentional, while an agenda is subconscious.
[[ ]()] Agenda and bias are the same and can be used interchangeably.
[[ ]()] Bias only applies to political reporting, while an agenda applies to all media.
[[X]]  Bias influences how information is interpreted, while an agenda determines what information is selected and emphasized.



#### Conclusion

> You finished lesson three! You've expanded your knowledge of how to investigate sources. Three new techniques were introduced:
> 
> - "Just add wikipedia", but for names and organizations
> - Google Scholar searches for verifying expertise
> - Google News searches for information about organizations and individuals
> 
> Additionally, you learned
> 
> - What state media is, and how to identify it
> - The difference between bias and agenda, and why it matters

### 04.04 | Find Trusted Coverage

> We've covered:
> 
> (S)top!
> 
> (I)nvestigate the source
> 
> And now we get to F: Find trusted coverage.
> 
> Sometimes when you investigate the source you'll find that the source is sufficient for your needs. We saw, for instance, an article on global warming written by a person that was an expert on the impact of climate change, and even though their point — that some activists were exaggerating climate impacts — was annoying to some on both the left and the right, we saw the opinion and analysis worthy of our attention.
> 
> Sometimes we can't determine the reliability of the source. And most of the time we don't really care about the source at all. We just want to get an accurate story on the subject from somewhere.
> When the initial source you encounter is low quality and you just care about the claim your best strategy might be to find a better source altogether. We're going to show you how to do that in this lesson.
> 
> But first a story about Keanu Reeves.

**Quick checks for other reporting: Keanu Reeves**

> Celebrity death hoaxes happen from time to time — in fact, one of the first big viral pieces of web fakery was a 2001 report that Britney Spears had died in a car crash. So when we see news that a celebrity has died, it's good to be cautious.
> 
> On the other hand, we're not monsters. If someone did actually die — whether Prince or Tom Petty or a favorite YouTube star — we'd like to express our emotions about it. We'd like to share the news with others. It's emotional, and we don't want to treat it like a research project. Luckily, it really isn't hard to see if something is a death hoax or not. Just check trusted coverage.
> 
> How do you do this? Well, consider this report that "Keanu Reeves is dead."

![Image of a headline saying that Keanu Reeves has died in a snowboard accident][image-32]

> Is it true? If it was, we'd expect there to be lots of news stories about it. So we check.

![GIF showing that Keanu Reeves was very much alive as that headline was claiming he had died][image-33]

> What do we find? The top stories about Keanu Reeves are about him making a surprise stop to sign a fan's yard sign. Doesn't sound very dead! Just to be sure, we search for `Keanu Reeves dead` and the only thing that comes up are stories about how a video game with "Death" in the title almost featured Reeves.
> 
> Conclusion: Keanu Reeves is not dead.

**Most big stories get covered by multiple outlets**

> What does it look like when some one actually *has* died? This is a bit morbid, but the morning I am writing this MMA boxer Maxim Dadashev passed away due to injuries sustained in a fight. He was a minor figure you've probably not heard of, and yet when we search `Maxim Dadashev dead` in Google News search we find there are already multiple stories confirming this.

![GIF showing Maxim Dadas has died][image-34]

> We click through to the USA Today story here, but we really didn't need to. Just seeing this many results on the news page is good enough for us to believe a claim of this sort. Go ahead and share this story, comment on it, and feel what emotions you have to.



What Mike Caulfield just described in how he checked to see if Keanu Reeves had actually died is known as lateral reading. **Lateral reading** is a strategy used in information literacy where readers verify the credibility of a source by leaving the page and searching for information about the source from other reputable websites. Instead of analyzing a webpage solely based on its own content (as in traditional vertical reading), lateral reading involves opening new tabs, checking external sources, and cross-referencing claims with trusted outlets. This method is commonly used by fact-checkers and researchers to quickly assess a source’s reliability and agenda.



**04.04a: Reflection questions**

- Why did we search for Keanu Reeves instead of Keanu Reeves snowboard?
- Why do you think so many otherwise smart people make errors when it comes to death hoaxes? What are the emotional drivers? What are the social incentives that push people not to check?
- What is one specific way that you could practice lateral reading about a topic that sometimes gets you going on social media? I'll give you a hint. In early 2025, Apple was criticized because its AI summary tool indicated that the wrong sports team had won. While of course consumers and news outlets want to see Apple do a better job, each of us also owes it to ourselves and to the communities in which we engage to do our part to demonstrate information literacy. So, for you, it might be an inaccurate sports result that requires lateral reading, while maybe for someone else, it involves politics. Be specific in your reflections. 

**Using fact-checks from news search: Chik-Fil-A**

Back to Dr. B for this brief interlude... Once I get a song in my head, I often have it floating around in there for quite some time. As soon as I saw Chik-Fil-A in this headline, I just had to share this one. It's such a good song, and maybe you've been sitting a while and need to take a quick mental break.  

!?[Louis Jordan Ain't Nobody Here But Us Chickens 1956][330]

Ok. We had better get back, right? Back to Mike Caulfield, gettin' us SIFTing along... 

> In our Keanu Reeves example, the absence of any news stories was telling. But many times when you use Google News (or other news search) you'll find something better: a fact-check on the claim.
> 
> Let's take a story circulating as I write this, one claiming a Georgia lawmaker believed she was told by a Chik-Fil-A employee to "go back to her country" but later clarified that she was mistaken.

![Headline: Georgia lawmaker claims Chick-Fil-A employee told her to go back to her country, later clarifies he actually said 'my pleasure'][image-35]

> In this case we do the news search, and we do find something: a fact-check by Snopes:

![GIF of Google search for Chick-Fil-A Georgia county][image-36]



> The Snopes fact-check labels this as false, but more importantly it presents the background in detail: a similar incident happened at another store sometime earlier, but the *Babylon Bee* is a satirical publication that created a very similar (but false) story.
> 
> Snopes initially gave this story a "false" rating, but many objected, claiming that the site did not attempt to hide it was satire, and labeling satirical articles as false was unfair (and a bit humorless!). Snopes made a counterargument that *Babylon Bee* articles were repeatedly shared by readers as true, due to a deceptive way the *Bee* constructs articles (a practice sometimes called fauxtire). Eventually Snopes relented and introduced a new ruling: "labelled satire."
> 
> So was Snopes right in the initial ruling? Wrong? Somewhere in between? Was this a case of semi-intentional deception, or just satire not funny enough for people to recognize as satire? 
> 
> Here's the thing: people can get twisted in knots over the ruling, and both sides can go into outrage over the unfairness of it all, but for you as a fact-checker the ruling doesn't matter so much. It's the fact-checking article that is most valuable to you. 
> 
> Fact-checks are useful to web readers because they are designed to give a concise explanation of particular claims and because good fact checks (like good Wikipedia articles) show their work by linking to high quality sources that you can look at yourself. The ruling is helpful, but isn't what matters most: it's the explanation and all the links they've compiled for you. If you doubt this ruling, you can click to the site itself and see that both sides have a point, the *Babylon Bee* bills themselves as a satirical publication, although, as Snopes initially noted, this is not made as clear as it might be.



**Vocabulary: Fact-check, Snopes, Politifact, Babylon Bee**

- To **fact-check** means to verify the accuracy of a claim, statement, or article by consulting credible sources and evidence before accepting it as true.
- **Snopes** is a well-known fact-checking website that investigates rumors, misinformation, and urban legends, providing researched explanations and verdicts on their accuracy.
- **Babylon Bee** is a satirical website that publishes humor and parody articles, often with a conservative Christian perspective, sometimes mistaken for real news.
- **PolitiFact** is a fact-checking organization that evaluates political claims using a **Truth-O-Meter** rating system, assessing statements from public figures and organizations for accuracy.



**05.04b: Reflection Questions**

- The *Babylon Bee* has been criticized by many for repeatedly writing satire that is not notably satirical enough for people to recognize it as a joke. Critics say that this is reckless, as most people will develop false impressions from reading the headlines that float past on Facebook. What are your thoughts on this? Some links on this issue are included at the bottom of this section.

- If people are sharing a story as if it is true, it makes sense for Snopes to fact-check it. But is "False" the correct rating for satire or fauxtire? Look at the [ratings Snopes uses][331] and develop two arguments: one argument that Snopes should introduce a new category of "satire", and one argument that it should not.

- Even if you disagree with the rating of false, does the Snopes article give you enough information to make up your own mind?

**05.04c: Reflection Activity**

Browse 2-3 of the listed fact-checking websites and add to your notes reflections of what you discovered. Include links to what you explored, as well as your written or video commentary. 

While we are learning to do quick fact-checking via Mike Caulfield's SIFT framework, it is great to have websites dedicated to more extensive research that goes into checking these claims. 



#### Scanning results using "click restraint"

> Some times a search on a claim will turn up multiple stories, many of which are not relevant. Consider this bit of viral news that circulated on Facebook:
> 
> **You know when you go to Walmart and they have the wipes to clean your cart handle? How many of you don’t use them? Well I do, and I always thought of the germs only. Was told today that the police chief also suggests you do it also because of all the problems with drugs now days, and if they have fentanyl or something like that still on their hands and they touch that cart handle and then you do, it can get into your system. Scary but worth taking the time to clean the handle. All you’d have to do is rub your nose or touch your child’s mouth.**
> 
> Searching initially on just fentanyl shopping cart gives a mixed bag of results.

![search results for fentanyl shopping carts][image-37]

> When we scan the blurbs we find that the first article — even though it is from a reputable source — contains the words fentanyl and shopping cart, but is not really about fentanyl on shopping carts. Likewise, the reference to shopping carts in the second one is to homelessness, not grocery store drug scares. It's the text of the third result that's in line with what we're researching, and that's the one we want to click. (Though once getting there we may want to use our source investigation techniques on Forbes).

**Vocabulary: click restraint**

- **Click restraint** is a term introduced by Sam Wineburg and Sarah McGrew to describe a behavior fact-checkers exhibit that less skilled people do not. Fact-checkers scan multiple results to try and find the particular result that combines trustworthiness with relevance before they click, often visiting the second page of search results.

#### Remember to stop

> This brings us to the move that often gets forgotten by students: the "S" in SIFT for "stop." As seen above, one aspect of "stopping" is to stop before you reflexively click the top search result. You want to take a second or two to make sure you're clicking the best result, not just the first one you see.
> 
> Another aspect of stopping is occasionally reformulating a search. We do see one fact-check in the above results, but perhaps we're surprised we don't see more. Maybe we start reading the Forbes story but find it unclear. If the results are not what we want we can modify the search query, here by adding "fact-check".

![GIF showing fentanyl grocery cart fact check][image-38]

> When we do that we see at least a half dozen fact-checks on this from Poynter (a well known fact-checking outfit), CBS News, and others. We choose the CBS News link and find a good explanation of why the fentanyl story is highly improbable, combined with advice that wiping those handles during flu season is something you might want to do anyway.

#### Not everything in Google News is credible

> Although we mentioned this earlier in the course, it bears repeating. Using news search can give you a more trustworthy set of results than web search, but there are still untrustworthy sites in the mix, including a few that publish outright false information.
> 
> The same way that you practice click restraint in looking for the most relevant link, you should also practice click restraint and choose the most credible result on the page. It won't always be the first. As we practice this more, choosing the best result will become much easier.

**SIFTing: UN Dance Protesting Nikki Haley (Prompt)**

> Early in 2018 the Trump administration announced that it would withdraw financial support for Palestine unless the country agreed to concessions. U.S. Ambassador Nicki Haley presented the U.S. position on the matter to the U.N. in January.
> 
> Then, according to many people on Twitter, something amazing happened. In defiance of the Nicki Haley's pronouncement, the Palestinian delegation got up... and began to dance!

![Screenshot of Sacha Saeen showing what was claimed to be dancing in protest][image-39]

> Text reads: "The Palestinian representative played a song on his mobile phone & danced at the UN as a response to Nikki Haley announcing that the U.S. will be cutting aid to Palestinians unless they recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital."
> 
> Fact check this, then answer the following questions in your fact-checking notebook under the heading UN DANCE:

**04.04d: Questions**

Add the following questions to your reflection notes and answer them. 

- Is the video unaltered (i.e., a "real" video)?

- Is this video really a reaction to U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley?
- What else can you tell us about this video, and how do you know it?

**SIFTing: UN Dance Protesting Nikki Haley (Discussion)**

> So let's take a look:

![Search for UN dance protest and resulting story on Snopes][image-40]

> In this case we could just click the fact-check we see in the general search, assuming we either recognized Snopes or Al-Araby as a reputable source. If we don't recognize those sources or see relevant material, we click into Google News.
> 
> Our finding? The clip is miscaptioned. It's not from 2018, it's not about Trump or Nikki Haley or protest. It's an enjoyable but rather unremarkable clip of a 2013 event where a famous Palestinian singer was invited to sing at the United Nations.

#### False frames

> While there are videos and photos that are fake or manipulated online, a far more common tactic is to take real media and miscaption it. The example above is pretty blatant. But often it is more subtle — and more dangerous.
> 
> Take for example this infamous tweet that was posted after the London Bridge bombing.

![photo 'framed' with reference to terror attack][image-41]

> The picture is real, but the way the poster would like you to see it is not. The frame here is that a woman wearing a hijab cares so little about victims of Islamic extremist violence that she won't even look up from her phone.
> 
> The image pinged around the web with that story, and while this version has blurred out the face, the face was not blurred in the original. People believed this specific woman was a monster.
> 
> But was that the frame through which they should have viewed it? After the photo and false frame had circulated through the web the real story emerged. The poster had chosen one of two photos, with the second photo showing that she was clearly in shock:

![Woman with her head covered, looking upset and distraught][image-42]

> When news outlets contacted the photographer, he said the woman was like many people that day walking past — she would have just come through a much more devastating scene, and been in shock, and the rescuing teams did not want assistance, they wanted space to do their jobs. Many people were on their phones as they tried to reach relatives. The photo the poster didn't choose clearly shows the trauma and concern.

![people gathered around someone lying on the ground | Reuters/Toby Melville. Used under fair use provision][image-43]

> Because of the falsely framed photo the woman was viciously attacked by others on social media. When contacted by reporters, she mentioned she was [calling her family][350] to tell them she was OK:
> 
> **She said her feelings at the time were of sadness, fear and concern, and added that she had talked to other witnesses to try to find out what was happening and see if she could offer help. She then called her family and helped a woman get to Waterloo station.**

#### Sharpening the event

> Some frames aren't wholly false, but are sharpened to the point where they are deceptive. An example of this sort of sharpening was the 2019 Covington student altercation with a Native American drummer in Washington D.C.
> 
> In this case, initial footage was shared on Twitter and through other outlets that seemed to show Catholic high school students wearing Make America Great Again hats surrounding a Native elder during a drumming ceremony to mock him.
> 
> The characterization was not completely incorrect. But the reaction to the video was heavily influenced by the starting point of the edit. While the framing of the video initially made it seem as if the students surrounded the drummer to mock him, later videos that emerged showed that the drummer had in fact approached the students.
> 
> Discussing these things can be difficult, because even after the frame is corrected, the original intensity of feeling still remains. It's particularly hard in this case, because in the full video there are still questions to be asked about appropriate conduct and cultural respect.
> 
> But one's emotional reaction to students who actively surround an older man as a mob and block his exit in order to mock his culture is different than one's reaction to watching students respond inappropriately to an older man that approaches them in what they feel is a confusing manner.
> 
> In this case both sides lost. Had the longer video been released first, a productive discussion might have been possible. Instead, the initial video fired one group of people into a frenzy, while the revelations of subsequent videos caused the other side to dismiss the behavior entirely.
> 
> We'll come back to this point later, when we talk about the "T" in SIFT. But for now remember that even if photos and videos are "real" it's important to check trusted sources to make sure you have the whole story. If it turns out you were reacting to something manipulated or falsely framed, consider that your initial reaction was wrong, and adjust accordingly.

**SIFTing: ATM rats (prompt)**

> Take a look at this story about a rat eating ATM cash in India.

![John D'oh account: "That's an expensive lunch!" With a headline Rat dies after gorging on cash while stuck in ATM from mandatory.com][image-44]

> We could look and see if "mandatory.com" is trustworthy, but in this case that's not really what we care about. We just want to know if this story been reported by reputable sources. 
> 
> Go to Google News search and see if other sites are reporting this. If there are other sites, choose the site you feel is the best source for this story. If it does not appear to be true, explain how you came to that conclusion.
> 
> Enter the results in your fact-checking notebook under the heading ATM RATS.

**SIFTing: ATM rats (discussion)**

> Let's take a look!

![Google search for atm rat cash india][image-45]

> In this case there's a lot of good sources on that search page. I chose Reuters, due to their expertise with international reporting, but most choices here are fine. At the time I did this search I saw Newsweek, USA Today, BBC News, Thrillist (a culture site), and Business Insider.
> 
> What is our response here? Well it might be something like this:
> 
> **The story appears to be true — Google News shows it being reported by multiple outlets including some reputable outlets I recognize. I chose the Reuters article, and looked up Reuters on Wikipedia before reading it. It's a well-known news agency with an international focus. The story itself to me seems a bit fishy (I mean really!?) and maybe I'm just a little suspicious that the camera didn't catch the rat going into the ATM. But the idea the rat ate (or shredded, technically) the money is in fact the consensus of both reporters and the bank authority there, so I'm inclined to go with their take on it.**
> 
> One thing to note here: a lot of people get hung up on whether something could possibly be false. And it's good that people are suspicious. There are sloppy reporters out there, and government regulators don't always tell the truth.
> 
> But doubt is a position too. Your mileage may vary, but for me, even though I can imagine a scenario in my head where someone steals some money from the ATM then shreds the remaining money and tosses a dead rat in there to blame it on, the truth is I am 13,000 miles away from this event, have not reviewed any of the evidence directly, don't know the local environment, the trustworthiness of the people involved, the sequence of events.
> 
> Under such circumstances it's fine to say, yeah, for the moment — given there is a whole universe of police and reporters out there looking at this with resources and insights and skills I don't have — it's most likely that the rat really ate the money. **If new evidence emerges, you can change your mind.**
> 
> This is a really subtle point, and we'll talk about it more later.

#### Trading up

> Often we get trustworthy news from not so trustworthy places. Maximum.com might be a great site, but it's unlikely, in this case, that they individually verified a story in India. They are just re-reporting it. Social media exacerbates the issue, since which article reaches you is more determined by the clickbaity-ness of their headline than the quality of their reporting.
> 
> By searching a claim and getting a story from a news source that has a verification process in place you not only verify the claim, but you end up with a better story to share with others. We call this "trading up." The idea behind trading up is that you can use social media to discover stories relevant to you, but when you find the stories, take a moment to "zoom out" and get the best reporting or analysis on it, rather than simply reading the specific article that happens to find its way to you.
> 
> When you use social media in this way, you let social media do what it does best (personalized topic discovery) while relying on either news or other search to address social media's big problem (credibility, clickbait, manipulation). If you find a better story on the subject, share that story instead, and in doing so make social media a bit better for everyone.

#### How to use reverse image search to find trusted coverage

> Sometimes (many times!) claims or stories will come to you in the form of images. If you want to find trusted coverage of the issue, claim, or photo, you have a couple options:
> 
> - You can search on some relevant text from the image, if, for example it is a meme or a supposed photograph of a sign
> - You can use reverse image search. We show you how to do this in Google Chrome below, but other browsers have similar methods.
> 
> Keep in mind that if reverse image search (bullet #2) is difficult due to the device or browser you are using, you can usually get pretty far with the text search of Google Images. 
> 
> Watch the video, then go to the next page to check your skills.

**SIFTing: John Lennon's murderer? (prompt)**

On the night of Monday, 8 December 1980, former Beatle and well-known peace activist John Lennon was shot dead by Mark David Chapman in the archway of his residence in New York City. Lennon had just returned from the recording studio with his wife, Yoko Ono.

It is a well-known fact that hours before he shot him, the killer approached John Lennon for an autograph. But this photo has been shared with you with the caption "Creepy photo shows John Lennon signing album for his killer hours before his death!"

![photo of John Lennon looking down and autographing something][image-46]

**Questions**

Answer the following questions in your fact-checking notebook:

- Is the photo real and unaltered?
- Is this really a photo of John Lennon signing an album for his killer?
- What else do you know about the photograph?

> In this case the photo is real, and the framing of the photo (that Lennon is signing an album for his killer) is accurate.

#### Quick note from Dr. B about failure

I'm writing these words on January 4, 2024 (Dr. B). I wanted to break in here and say something about being wrong. I am going through the SIFT modules, again, despite having done so years ago. I use Safari for my web browser, so don't have quite as easy a time doing the reverse-image search as Mike shows in his video and GIFs. Long story short, I wound up finding the story in a tabloid and thought it was therefore fake. When I rewatched Mike's video, I discovered that I had both remembered wrong and followed down a rabbit trail that didn't pay off. 

All of us are going to be wrong in our lives. The strange thing about failure is how much it can benefit us, if we let it. Cognitive researcher Robert Bjork runs a memory lab at UCLA. When I got to talk to him for my podcast, years ago, he said some memorable words. 

> Forgetting is the friend of learning. 
> 
> --Robert Bjork

I know it is easy for me to say not to worry if you're not getting all of these prompts right on your first try. Too much of education focuses on high stakes assessments, which don't always measure what they claim to... If you find yourself failing on some of these exercises, be sure to record it in your notebook. It will help deepen your learning. Now back to our regularly-scheduled program: aka Mike Caulfield. 

#### Why not examine the photo itself?

> One question I get asked from time to time is why I encourage people to look for trusted coverage rather than examine the photo itself for photoshopping. Many people have the experience of having seen something that is obviously fake. So why not look for signs of fakery?

![one of the many examples of the internet meme 'this looks shopped'][image-47]

> In practice we've found that this approach fails for a number of reasons. The biggest reason? 
> 
> Let's provide an example first. The following image is presented online as evidence of a chemical spill in Hungary.

![photo of trees with the lower parts of the trunks all turned brown][image-48]



> Is it shopped? Most people would say yes. But, actually, it *isn't*. It's really the effect of one of the worst industrial accidents in recent European history:

Watch: [Video of the tsunami of toxic sludge in Southwest Hungary][353] (2:18m)

> That's an extreme example, with a very weird looking picture, but stare at any image long enough and you'll find something wrong with it. Unless you're an expert in digital manipulation (you're not), it's better to find trusted commentary than pull out the magnifying glass.

**04.04e: Questions** 

- When would a reverse-image search be more helpful? 
- When would it be more of a waste of time to do a reverse-image search as part of your fact checking? 

#### Conclusion

> In this section you've learned to find trusted coverage when trying to determine if a claim is reliable. You learned three techniques:
> 
> - Scanning Google News for relevant stories
> - Using known fact-checking sites
> - Reverse image searching to find relevant sources on an image
> 
> Next we'll look at our final move: Tracing claims, quotes, and media to the original context.

### 04.05 | Trace claims, quotes, and media to their original context

> Most stuff you see on the web is not original reporting or research. Instead, it is often commentary on the re-reporting of re-reporting on some original story or piece of research. And that's a problem.
> 
> Now, in some cases stories or findings get better as they pass through intermediaries. If I tell a reporter a piece of gossip I heard, and they go out and verify it by talking to eyewitnesses and experts, their report on my piece of gossip is probably more accurate than my gossip. If a scientist gets a result and another scientist with a talent for explaining things blogs it, maybe the second explanation is better than the first. Research also shows that as gossip gets passed around, sometimes important details that were missed become more prominent.
> 
> But in most cases, the more a story is passed around, the more it starts to become a bit warped. That's due to a bunch of reasons. Human nature is to exaggerate stories for effect. Desire of websites to get advertising dollars can result in them printing the most shocking version of something. And there are bad actors: people who will take a story that has some nuance to it and remove the details that provide that nuance, or invent details that didn't exist.
> 
> Very often by the time a story finds you on the web it has been altered so much that it presents a radically wrong version of an event or a piece of research. The person you are reading usually did no original reporting, made no phone calls to check facts, and often barely skimmed the original story before writing up their blog post, thinkpiece, hot take, or re-reported news item. And so they either get things wrong by mistake, or, in some cases, intentionally mislead.

#### Trace it to the original

> Fortunately, there is a solution to this problem. Usually, the original reporting, research, or photo is available on the web. By going to the original reporting or research source (or finding a high quality secondary source that did the hard work of verification) you can get a story that is more complete, or a research finding that is more accurate. This two minute video shows you how going to the source can be as easy as clicking through a link:

!?[Online verification skills - Video 3 - find the original source][354]

#### Leveling, sharpening, and assimilation

> Early studies of rumors suggested that as rumors traveled further from the source they were altered in predictable ways. They were"leveled" — as they traveled, details are stripped out. They are also "sharpened" — certain small details are added or emphasized to give the story more "punch". And both of these processes happened in the context of "assimilation" — the details that were omitted and the details that were added or emphasized are chosen because they either fit what the speaker thinks is the main theme of the story, or what the speaker thinks the listener will be most interested in.
> 
> Later research called into question the particular nature of these processes, but these three actions are a helpful way of thinking about the sorts of alterations people can make to claims, quotes, and media as they pass them along.
> 
> These processes are not necessarily bad. It means that as a story travels it often becomes more concise, more engaging, and more geared toward the interest of its audience. Think of a long-winded story full of details that someone has told you which you have then retold. Assuming you have a credible take on what the story is about, you'll probably forget the irrelevant details, and remember the most memorable ones. So when you retell it, you'll provide a shorter more engaging version customized to your audience. And that's good! One reason many people enjoy getting news from social media is it can be much more *efficient* than a longer news story, calling out the pieces that really matter to you in particular.
> 
> But the same way that these processes can provide value in the hands of careful storytellers, they can be damaging in the hands of those who are careless, are guided by strong bias, or are motivated to distort the truth for their own benefit.
> 
> Consider this tweet from our old friend John D'oh:

![John D'oh tweets "It might be time to ditch the sunscreen"; headline from moms.com says FDA warns chemicals from sunscreen enter your bloodstream after one day][image-49]

> John is tweeting his takeaway from this article on sunscreen (or at least his takeaway from the article headline):

![Headline from moms.com: FDA warns chemicals from sunscreen enter your bloodstream after one day][image-50]

> But the article doesn't say to ditch your sunscreen. And it doesn't even say that the FDA is warning people about the chemicals. The study merely concluded that given the levels of the chemicals in the bloodstream — from applying sunscreen four times a day — that additional regulation might be warranted:
> 
> > They found that these 24 participants had higher than what is recommended of these chemicals in their blood. This amount is based on what the FDA’s says is how much of these active ingredient can be in someone’s bloodstream before it needs to be tested for safety concerns...
> 
> This article isn't from a reliable source, and is in fact pulling all its quotes from another article. It's reporting on reporting. If you click through to the link (supposedly to the research article) it links to a CNN story.
> 
> And in that story you notice the re-reporters left something out:
> 
> > So, should you stop using sunscreen? Absolutely not, experts say.
> > 
> > "Studies need to be performed to evaluate this finding and determine whether there are true medical implications to absorption of certain ingredients," said Yale School of Medicine dermatologist Dr. David Leffell, a spokesman for the American Academy of Dermatology. He added that in the meantime, people should "continue to be aggressive about sun protection."
> 
> The original story *actually says the opposite* of what the tweeter proposed.
> 
> You could trace it back even further, but we can stop there. A story came out that mentioned the research, but made it clear that there is not any known danger yet, and that people should continue to use the sunscreen they are using in the meantime. That gets rewritten, with that detail omitted or downplayed (leveled). It then gets summarized by John D'oh — who "sharpens" the advice, and ends up stating the exact opposite of what the original story said.
> 
> When looking at information of this sort, figure out what the original reporting source was, and go take a look. Some publications can add value, particularly if reporters are experienced and knowledgeable in the field they are reporting in. But if it's clear the thing your looking at is just re-reporting of reporting, go up to the source and once at the source do your normal (I)nvestigate the Source moves.

#### Beware the sourceless story

> Consider this post by John D'oh, in which he references [an article from Curious Mind Magazine][355]:



![John D'oh tweet: "I've said it before and will say it again -- school kills creativity. Looks like NASA agrees with me, according to this research"][image-51]

> If you go to that story you'll find references to a "NASA study" — however, when you click on the link it's not to the study (which was apparently from 1968) but rather to a summary of the study in an information technology magazine from the 2005. The study itself appears to never have been published directly or reported on contemporaneously. You can keep digging, and what you'll eventually find is what citations that exist to the study are not to the 1968 study, but a 1992 book Land wrote with his wife which told the story of the study he had done over 20 years before. Importantly the study wasn't even a NASA study: it was a study he did privately using a test that he had developed for NASA. It's unclear what NASA's take was on the test, since, again, the only account we have of it is from 1992.
> 
> This is not to doubt Land's honesty. But the perceived authority of the study for many readers comes from the idea it was conducted by NASA and was substantial research at the time. When you attempt to trace the claim to the original context you find that the trail ends in 1992, it was not published at the time, and was not conducted by NASA. That changes how you might view the claim.

#### SIFTing with Artificial Intelligence

I removed a few of Mike Caulfield's examples from his original course, but wanted to share something more current (2025) that he's been experimenting with... He created a custom GPT called Well-Grounded which isn't focused on fact-checking. Instead, you can upload a screenshot and the GPT is programmed to use the [Toulmin model of argument][356] to analyze it.

If you would like to learn more about Mike Caulfield's custom GPT, check out his [How to Use the Well-Grounded AI Argument Analyzer post on Substack][357].

## 05. The good

![Course lesson graphic 05][image-52]

When talking about  business ethics, the saying "the good, the bad, and the ugly" really sums up the complex ethical challenges we face in the workplace. This idea comes from a famous Western movie made by Sergio Leone in 1966, but the phrase's use has extended well beyond the movie. 

!? [The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly - official trailer][361]

In *The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly*, we see characters dealing with a world that's full of greed, betrayal, and the struggle to survive. The movie an example of how messy and complicated our moral choices can get, with the lines between right and wrong often blurring because of different motivations and interests. 

When we talk about business ethics using this framework, I will be using "the good" to refer to all the actions done with integrity, accountability, and a sense of responsibility towards society. On the flip side, when I share about "the bad," this covers all those illegal actions that also break ethical guidelines. And as for "the ugly"? That's where we will explore those actions that might not be illegal but are still morally questionable or harmful to society in some way.

##### ? 05.00 | Review questions | The good, the bad, and the ugly

Before we can start talking about the various ways that companies may structure themselves to align with their core purpose and values, it is essential to review some key terms that you perhaps have already heard about in other classes. 

### 05. 01 | The benefits of structuring as a corporation

> The concept of **limited liability** means that the owners (shareholders or stockholders) of corporations, as well as directors and managers, are protected by laws stating that in most circumstances, their losses in case of business failure cannot exceed the amount they paid for their shares of ownership ([Figure 4.2][369]). The same protection applies to owners of some other business entities such as limited liability companies (LLCs). An LLC is similar to a corporation in that owners have limited liability; however, it is organized and managed more like a partnership. For purposes of granting owners the protection of limited liability, several types of entities are possible within each state, including a corporation, an LLC, a limited liability partnership, and a limited partnership.

![A diagram showing the relationship of corporate directors to limited liability. A large centered circle is labeled “Corporation”. Just overlapping the “Corporation” circle on the left edge is a circle labeled “Directors”. Just overlapping the “Corporation” circle on the top edge is a circle labeled “Shareholders”. Just overlapping the “Corporation” circle on the right edge is a circle labeled “Officers”. An arrow extends from the “Shareholders” circle to the “Directors” circle. An arrow extends from the “Directors” circle to the “Officers” circle. Inside the bottom edge of the “Corporation” circle is a circle labeled “Liability is limited to corporate assets”.][image-53]

***Figure*\* **4.2\*\* Corporate shareholders elect directors who appoint the company’s officers—all of whom benefit from limited liability. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)\*

> Without state incorporation laws, business owners would be subject to personal liability for business losses, which could create several disadvantages. Ownership would be riskier, so owners could have more difficulty selling their ownership interests. They could also be subject to a pro rata share of income taxes. These types of personal financial liability could limit the ability of businesses to raise capital by selling stock. Limited liability, by reducing the amount a shareholder can lose from investing in a corporation by buying its stock, increases the investment’s attractiveness to potential new shareholders. Ultimately, corporate status increases both the potential number of willing investors and the amount of capital they are likely to invest. After all, would you be willing to invest your money in a business if you knew not only that you could lose the capital you invested, but also that you could be sued personally for any and all debts of the business? 
> 
> Corporate status is conferred upon a business by state law (statute) when a state issues the business a charter of incorporation. The protective shield of corporate status enables businesses to socialize their losses in a way that traditional proprietorships and partnerships are not able to do. *Socializing* a loss is a means to amortize it or spread it out over society in general, so the owners do not absorb it individually. Amortization is similar to the idea behind insurance, in which many people bear a small share in a loss, rather than one or a few people bearing all of it. Therefore, it is accurate to say that society enables corporations to exist, both by passing laws that create them and by limiting the financial risk exposure of their owners. Since our society grants for-profit businesses the right to incorporate and make unlimited profits with limited liability, a reasonable person could conclude that corporations owe a debt to society in return. 
> 
> Corporations’ **quid pro quo**—a Latin term meaning *this for that*—is acceptance of corporate social responsibility, to benefit the many stakeholders to whom corporations may owe a duty, including customers, the community, the environment, employees, media, and the government ([Figure 4.3][370]).

![A diagram showing typical stakeholders. In the center is a circle labeled “Business Corporations”. Around the “Business Corporations” circle are six circles labeled “Government”, “Environment”, “Community”, “Media”, “Customers”, and “Employees”.][image-54]

***Figure*\* **4.3\*\* A corporation’s typical stakeholders include (but are not limited to) its customers or clients, the community in which it operates, the natural environment, its employees, the media, and the government.

#### Balancing the Many Responsibilities of a Corporation

> A longstanding ethical debate about corporate social responsibility asks whether, in fact, a corporation owes a duty to society or only to its shareholders. The line of important court cases shaping this issue spans almost a century and includes a series of landmark cases involving the Ford Motor Company, the Wrigley Company, and Hobby Lobby.
> 
> In *Dodge v. Ford Motor Company* (1919), the Michigan Supreme Court ruled in favor of **shareholder primacy**, saying that founder Henry Ford must operate the Ford Motor Company primarily in the profit-maximizing interests of its shareholders.[2 ][380]In the traditional corporate model, a corporation earns revenue and, after deducting expenses, distributes the profits to shareholders in the form of dividends. Ford had announced that his company would stop paying big dividends to shareholders and instead would use its profits to achieve several other goals, including improving product quality, expanding company facilities, and perhaps most surprisingly, lowering prices. Shareholders then sued Ford, asking the court to order Ford Motor Company to continue allocating the lion’s share of profits to high dividend payments. (It is ironic that the named shareholders who sued Ford were the Dodge brothers, former Ford suppliers who had recently started their own car company.)
> 
> At the trial, Ford ([Figure 4.4][381]) testified that he believed his company was sufficiently profitable to consider its broader obligation and engage in activities to benefit the public, including its workers and customers. This was a unique position for the founder and primary owner of a large corporation to take in the early twentieth century. During the rise of capitalism in the United States, most owners sought only to maximize profits, because that was the primary basis of their ability to attract capital and to reinvest in the company. Most investors were interested in a healthy return on their investment, rather than any type of social good. Shareholders contended that the concern Ford expressed for his workers and customers was both improper and illegal. The court agreed, and Ford was forced to abandon his managerial goal of balancing profits and realizing broader social goals.[3][382]

> Ironically, in the same case, the court upheld the validity of a doctrine known as the **business judgment rule**, a common-law principle stating that officers, directors, and managers of a corporation are not liable for losses incurred when the evidence demonstrates that decisions were reasonable and made in good faith, which gives corporate management latitude in deciding how to run the company.[4 ][383]Essentially, the business judgment rule holds that a court will not second-guess the decisions of a company’s managers or directors.
> 
> The legality and appropriateness of social responsibility as a business policy have followed a long and winding road since 1919. In the 1950s and 1960s, for example, some state courts rejected the shareholder primacy doctrine, instead ruling that a broad interpretation of the business judgment rule allowed managers discretion when it came to allocating company assets, including using them for programs demonstrating social awareness.
> 
> In 1968, in a highly publicized case, the court ruled that the board of directors of the Wrigley Company, of baseball and chewing gum fame, had a significant amount of discretion in determining how to balance the interests of stakeholders.[5 ][384]The case of **Shlensky v. Wrigley** (1968) revolved around William Wrigley Jr.’s ownership of the Chicago Cubs. The baseball team had steadfastly refused to install the lights necessary for playing night games at Wrigley Field, even though every other stadium in major league baseball had lights. Instead, the Cubs had respected the local community’s belief that night baseball games and their associated lights would negatively affect the surrounding neighborhood, creating more opportunities for crime. In the view of some investors, however, the Cubs’ decision was depressing profits for shareholders. The shareholders brought a challenge against the Wrigley Company, but the Cubs’ owners won the case.
> 
> The Wrigley case represented a shift from the idea that corporations should pursue only the maximization of shareholder value, as had been held in the Ford Motor Company case.[6 ][385]As a follow-up to this case, lights were finally installed at Wrigley Field in 1988, but only after the owner, William Wrigley III, had sold the team (in 1981) to the Tribune Company, a large media conglomerate that fought for six years to install lights. However, the case stands as precedent for the ability of management to balance various interests and profits when making decisions.
> 
> Dodge v. Ford\* (1919) and *Shlensky v. Wrigley* (1968) established the dynamic nature of the debate over the shareholder primacy doctrine and indicated a shift in both legal thought and precedent toward allowing management greater latitude in deciding how to best manage a corporation. A more recent decision, *Burwell v. Hobby Lobby* (2014), demonstrated what some may consider the double-edged sword of this latitude.[7 ][386]In a 5–4 decision in favor of Hobby Lobby, the Supreme Court ruled that some corporations (those that are closely held by a few shareholders) can object on ethical, moral, or religious grounds to the Affordable Care Act’s rule that health insurance policies must cover various forms of contraception; such companies can elect not to offer such coverage.
> 
> The majority opinion in the case was written by Justice Samuel Alito, joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, and Anthony Kennedy. In essence, the Court ruled that business owners could place their personal values first and follow their own agenda. The case received a great deal of publicity, some of it quite negative. Essentially, the Court held in this case that “corporate law does not require for-profit corporations to pursue profit at the expense of everything else,”[8 ][387]similar to the ruling in the Chicago Cubs/Wrigley Field case.
> 
> The decision was a victory for the family that owns Hobby Lobby and has been praised by some and criticized by others for expanding the rights of corporate owners. Some analysts believe it represents more than just an expansion of management prerogative and enlarges the right of corporations to be treated as a “person.” The Hobby Lobby case can be interpreted to mean the people who control corporations (owners and/or management) may act on their own values in a way that might well be inconsistent with the interests of employees and other minority shareholders. In the majority decision, Alito wrote, “A corporation is simply a form of organization used by human beings to achieve desired ends. When rights, whether constitutional or statutory, are extended to corporations, the purpose is to protect the rights of these people.”[9 ][388]Hobby Lobby is primarily owned by one family, and Alito’s comments seem to suggest that another interpretation would limit the applicability of the case to only closely held corporations, in which the majority of the stock is owned by a small number of shareholders.
> 
> Some might think Henry Ford’s attempt to forego profits in order to pay workers higher wages was a good choice but not find Hobby Lobby’s preference for limiting female employees’ health insurance benefits on religious grounds to be so. However, the law must be interpreted logically: If you give management the prerogative to put one social issue ahead of profits, should management not also be able to pursue any social issue of its choosing? An extension of the logic used in the Hobby Lobby case could lead to an expansion of the corporate rights of the personhood doctrine, for example, by allowing the individual right to privacy to become a shield against regulatory scrutiny by government agencies (although a corporation is not a natural person).
> 
> Another potential problem with giving management greater rights to pursue social agendas is protecting the interests of minority shareholders who disagree with the majority. Since corporation law is state law, the protections for minority shareholders vary widely, but owners of a small number of shares have little or no power to influence the choices the corporation makes. Some states allow cumulative voting for seats on the board of directors, which increases minority shareholder power. Others permit buyouts or dissolution statutes that apply to closely held corporations. However, in a traditional large corporation, none of these protections for minority interests are likely to apply. Of course, another option is for disgruntled shareholders to sell their shares.

#### Two Sides of the Corporate Responsibility Debate

> The issue of corporate social responsibility is the subject of high-level global discussion and debate among leaders in the public and private sectors, such as the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos, Switzerland. Numerous respected academic centers also hold forums on CSR, such as the Center on Democracy, Development, and the Rule of Law at Stanford University and the Harvard Law School Forum on Corporate Governance and Financial Regulation.
> 
> As we have seen, slow but steady acceptance of CSR as a legitimate business concept has led to the legal and ethical position that corporate directors and managers may exercise business judgment and discretion in running a **corporation**. This development has come about for multiple reasons: a) the fact that society allows LLCs to exist, **b**) the sheer magnitude of the economic power corporations possess, and c) the desire of corporations to act responsibly in order to avoid more extensive government regulation. Managers are usually accorded significant latitude as long as they can point to a rational interpretation of their actions as benefiting the **corporation** as a whole in the long term. The combination of economic and political power in the world’s largest corporations necessitates that executives consider the interests of a broader set of stakeholders, rather than only stockholders. Indeed, social, environmental, and charitable programs often create shareholder value rather than take away from it. And honoring obligations to all stakeholders in a **corporation**—including those who own no stock shares—is the **moral minimum** a firm must undertake to satisfy the base threshold for acting ethically.
> 
> A recent study by researchers at Princeton and the University of Texas indicates that corporations benefit from following CSR policies in multiple ways.[10 ][389]These benefits are collectively called a “halo effect” and can add value to the business. As an example, consumers frequently take CSR spending as an indirect indicator that a company’s products are of high quality, and often they are also more willing to buy these products as an indirect way of donating to a good cause.
> 
> However, some economists, such as Milton Friedman, Henry Hazlitt, Adam Smith, and others, have argued that CSR initiatives based on environmental or social justice instead *limit* shareholder wealth.[11 ][390]The Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman (1912–2006) believed shareholders should be able decide for themselves what social initiatives to donate to or to take part in, rather than having a business executive decide for them. He argued that both government regulation and corporate social initiatives allow an outside third party to make these choices for shareholders.
> 
> In Friedman’s opinion, too much power assumed by corporate management in pursuing a social agenda might ultimately lead to a form of corporate autocracy. Supporters of the profit maximization principle believe it is a waste of corporate resources to reduce air pollution below the level required by law, to require vendors to participate in a sustainable supply chain initiative, or to pay lower-level employees a salary above the legally mandated minimum wage. Friedman asserted that “doing good deeds” is not the job of corporations; it is the right of those people who want to do them but should not be imposed on those who do not. His philosophy asserts that socially oriented initiatives are analogous to a form of outside regulation, resulting in higher costs to those corporations that follow socially responsible policies.
> 
> When Friedman was laying out this position in the 1970s, it reflected the prevailing opinion of a majority of U.S. shareholders and commentators on corporate law at that time. In the years since then, however, Friedman’s perspective has fallen into disfavor. This does not invalidate his point of view, but it does demonstrate that public opinion about corporations is subject to change over time. The subjectivity or relativity with which we view companies along with their perceived rights and responsibilities is a major theme this text addresses.
> 
> Do corporate directors owe a specific fiduciary duty to shareholders? A **fiduciary duty** is a very high level of legal responsibility owed by those who manage someone else’s money, which includes the duties of care and loyalty. Some examples of relationships that include a fiduciary duty are those between a trustee of an estate and its beneficiary, and between a fund manager and a client. According to the American Bar Association, the business judgment rule states “that as fiduciaries, corporate directors owe the corporation and its shareholders fiduciary duties of diligence and fidelity in performing their corporate duties. These fiduciary obligations include the duty of care and the duty of loyalty . . . the duty of care consists of an obligation to act on an informed basis; the duty of loyalty requires the board and its directors to maintain, in good faith, the corporation’s and its shareholders’ best interests over anyone else’s interests.”[12 ][391]So it would seem that the answer is yes, corporate directors do have a specific fiduciary duty to promote the best interests of the corporation. But what exactly does that duty entail? Does that specifically mean returning profits to shareholders in the form of dividends? As we have seen, these questions have frequently spilled over into the courts, in the form of shareholder lawsuits challenging the actions of directors and/or management.

#### Fiduciary duty and communication

> Fiduciary duty also includes a duty of communication, as you can read in the [oft-cited *Meinhard v. Salmon* case][392] from 1928, where the New York Court of Appeals held that business partners may have a fiduciary duty to one another regarding business opportunities that arise during the course of the partnership.
> 
> UCLA law professor [Steven Bainbridge wrote in the *New York Times*][393]: “If directors were allowed to deviate from shareholder wealth maximization, they would inevitably turn to indeterminate balancing standards, which provide no accountability.” As support for his position, Bainbridge pointed to a 2010 case, *eBay Domestic Holdings Inc. v. Newmark*, in which a Delaware court ruled that corporate directors are bound by fiduciary duties and standards that include “acting to promote the value of the corporation for the benefit of its stockholders.”
> 
> However, Lynn Stout, a professor at Cornell University Law School, wrote a contrasting piece in the *New York Times* in which she said, “There is a common belief that corporate directors have a legal duty to maximize corporate profits and shareholder value—even if this means skirting ethical rules, damaging the environment or harming employees. But this belief is utterly false. Modern corporate law does not require for-profit corporations to pursue profit at the expense of everything else, and many do not.”[15 ][394]Her opinion is based in part on the Hobby Lobby decision referenced above.
> 
> Thus, while ethicists may agree that corporations do indeed owe social responsibilities to society, legal experts still differ over this point. The fact that we have seen inconsistent decisions from the courts over the last century confirms the lack of legal consensus. Of course, both legal and ethical opinion are always in flux, so where the debate stands today in no way indicates where it will be in ten years. On this issue, public opinion, as well as that of politicians and even the courts, is like a pendulum swinging back and forth, usually between points of view that are center-right or center-left, rather than at the extremes. However, the pendulum is reset every so often, and the arc within which it swings may differ from era to era.

#### Enhancing Livelihoods through Unilever's Project Shakti

> According to management guru Peter Drucker, whose ideas significantly contributed to the foundations of thought about the workings of the modern business corporation, workers “need to know the organization’s mission and to believe in it.” How do organizations ensure this commitment? By satisfying workers’ values.[16 ][395]A program undertaken by Unilever, the Dutch-British multinational company co-headquartered in Rotterdam and London, illustrates the kind of values-oriented corporate endeavor Drucker describes. [Project Shakti][396] is a Unilever CSR initiative in India that links corporate social responsibility and financial opportunities for local women. It is considered a leading example of micro-entrepreneurship, and it expands the concept of sustainability to include not only environmental issues but also economic opportunity and financial networking in underdeveloped areas.
> 
> The goal, according to Unilever, is to give rural Shakti women the ability to earn money for themselves and their families as micro-entrepreneurs. Unilever’s subsidiary in India, Hindustan Lever, has started training programs for thousands of women in small towns and villages across India to help them understand how to run their own small sole proprietorships as distributors of the company’s products. With support from a team of rural sales managers, women who had been unable to support themselves are now becoming empowered by learning how a supply chain works, what products Hindustan Lever produces, and how to distribute them. The sales managers also act in a consulting capacity to help with business basics, money management, negotiations, and related skills that help the women run their businesses effectively.

![Shakti Project Unilever][image-56]

> The program was so successful that Unilever expanded it to include Shakti men, typically the sons, brothers, or husbands of the women already running businesses. The men, who are essentially like delivery drivers, sell Unilever products using bicycles for transportation, enabling them to cover a larger area than women cover on foot. The women spend most of their time running the business.
> 
> Project Shakti has enlisted more than 100,000 rural participants, which includes about 75,000 women. The project has changed their lives in ways that are profound, and not only because of the income earned. The women now have increased self-esteem based on a sense of empowerment, and they finally feel they have a place in Indian society. According to the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan, Project Shakti is one of the best and most sustainable ways the company can address women’s social concerns. It allows Unilever to conduct business in a socially responsible manner, helping women to help themselves while extending the reach of its products.

### 05.02 | An alternate business formation: the Benefit Corporation

Benefit corporations, or B Corps, represent a paradigm shift in corporate governance by allowing companies to prioritize social and environmental objectives alongside financial goals. Unlike traditional C corporations, which, as we have discussed, are often seen as legally required to prioritize the interests of shareholders above all else, benefit corporations have the flexibility to pursue a broader set of objectives that benefit various stakeholders, including employees, communities, and the environment. This alternative corporate structure enables companies to embed their social and environmental values into their DNA, aligning business practices with their broader mission and purpose. 

#### The movement

The B Corp movement is a collective endeavor aimed at transforming our economic system by redefining the rules of business. Led by organizations like B Lab, this movement mobilizes the B Corp community to tackle society's most pressing challenges through collective action and collaboration. B Corps are working together to build a more inclusive, sustainable, and equitable economy. Through advocacy, certification, and activism, the B Corp movement is driving meaningful change and inspiring businesses worldwide to prioritize purpose alongside profit. 

!?[B Corp Movement][405]

B Lab started in 2006 and seeks to transform the world's economies to place people and the planet over profits. They have established standards and networks such that companies can shift "our global economy from a system that profits few to one that benefits all: advancing a new model that moves from concentrating wealth and power to ensuring equity, from extraction to generation, and from prioritizing individualism to embracing interdependence." On the [B Corporation website][406] they stress: 

> We won’t stop until *all* business is a force for good.

#### Examples of B Corps

One example of a well-known benefit corporation we have explored often in this class is Patagonia, the outdoor apparel company renowned for its commitment to environmental sustainability and social responsibility. As a certified B Corp, Patagonia integrates environmental and social considerations into its business decisions, from supply chain management to product design and marketing. The company's mission statement guides its operations and drives innovation in sustainable practices:

> Build the best product, cause no unnecessary harm, use business to inspire and implement solutions to the environmental crisis.
> 
> -- Patagonia's mission statement

Warby Parker, a popular eyewear brand, exemplifies the benefits of the benefit corporation structure in prioritizing social impact. Beyond its core business of selling stylish and affordable eyewear, Warby Parker is committed to providing access to vision care for underserved communities. 

![Girl wearing glasses with a smile on her face][image-57]

Through its "Buy a Pair, Give a Pair" program, the company donates a pair of glasses to someone in need for every pair sold. By embracing the benefit corporation model, Warby Parker has been able to integrate its social mission into its business strategy, creating shared value for customers, employees, and society as a whole.

#### B Lab Standards

The B Lab standards serve as a comprehensive framework for assessing a company's social and environmental performance, transparency, and accountability. Developed by B Lab, these rigorous criteria evaluate various aspects of a company's operations, including its impact on workers, communities, customers, and the environment. By measuring performance across five key areas—governance, workers, customers, community, and environment—the B Lab standards provide a holistic assessment of a company's commitment to social and environmental responsibility. 

Companies that seek B Corp certification must measure their impact according to the B Lab's standards. The [B Impact Assessment][407] facilitates more then 150,000 organizations assessing and improving their "positive impact performance for environment, communities, customers, suppliers, employees, and shareholders." Through the B Corp certification process, companies undergo a thorough evaluation to ensure compliance with these standards, demonstrating their commitment to using business as a force for good. By adhering to the B Lab standards, companies can distinguish themselves as leaders in ethical and sustainable business practices, inspiring trust, loyalty, and positive impact among stakeholders.

### 05.03 | Stockholders, stakeholders, and goodwill

Historically, corporations have focused solely on how their actions will benefit investors. In fact, the very act of forming an entity as a corporation, can sometimes translate to the primary goal being related to financial gains for the organization. As discussed in the prior section, the debate about the extent to which corporations play a role in social good has been occurring for generations. Remember how Milton Friedman stressed that a business person's responsibility "[is to increase profits][413]"? Friedman believed that business people should stay focused on matters having to do with making money and contributing positively to the economy. His assertions have been influential to decades of business leaders and are known as the **Friedman doctrine**. 

Amy Merrick pushes back on Milton Friedman's myopic focus on profits in her article for Chicago Booth Review [Is the Friedman Doctrine Still Relevant in the 21st Century? A Year of Crises has Heightened the Debate About What Corporations Owe Society.][414] Merrick outlines the ways in which businesses are asked today to not only declare their values in tangible ways, but to back them up "with clear financial commitments, such as Netflix's pledge to invest $100 million in support of Black communities in the U.S." She also discusses the ways that social media have transformed the relationship between businesses and their stakeholders. Potential stockholders want to know that the companies they are investing in are demonstrating social impact, in addition to showing financial returns. Merrick concludes [the piece][415] by writing: 

> At a time of widespread crisis, companies may not have to choose between shareholders and the community. In the 21st century, enriching one may require boosting the other.

Legal and corporate governance experts disagree as to the extent to which corporations are required to have profits come before considering other stakeholder needs. In 2015, The New York Times ran a debate with multiple experts sharing their views regarding the question of whether "[the law allows corporations to pursue social goals like environmental sustainability or worker well being?][416]" [According to Lynn Stout][417], author of *The ShareHolder Value Myth*, corporations aren't required to maximize profits. She cites the [Hobby Lobby U.S. Supreme Court opinion][418], which states that: 

> Modern corporate law does not require for-profit corporations to pursue profit at the expense of everything else, and many do not."

David G. Yosifon, author of *Corporate Friction: How Corporate Law Impedes American Progress and What to Do About It*, offers a different perspective. He describes in [his contribution to the 2015 New York Times debate][419] how the vast majority of companies incorporate in Delaware. The state has been clear about shareholder value reigning supreme, as illustrated by a quote from the then chief justice of the Delaware Supreme Court, Leo Strine, stating in [a law review article][420] that: "Directors must make stockholder welfare their sole end." In the documentary The Corporation, the creators criticized the degree to which stockholders reap the benefits from companies' gains and the complex and often controversial nature of corporate power and its implications for our world. 

!?[The Corporation - the trailer][421]

Making a distinction between stockholders and stakeholders is essential as we reflect on the good, the bad, and the ugly, in a business context. From shareholders seeking financial returns to employees striving for meaningful work, and communities advocating for social responsibility, each stakeholder plays a vital role in shaping the reputation and success of a company.  

#### Stockholders

Stockholders are people who own a part of a company by buying its stocks. They can earn money when the company does well, usually through dividends or by selling their stocks for more than they paid for them. Stockholders are also called shareholders, as they own shares of stock. 

> Understanding the impact of a business decision on the stockholder and various other stakeholders is critical to the ethical conduct of business. Indeed, prioritizing the claims of various stakeholders in the company is one of the most challenging tasks business professionals face. Considering only stockholders can often result in unethical decisions; the impact on all stakeholders must be considered and rationally assessed.
> 
> Managers do sometimes focus predominantly on stockholders, especially those holding the largest number of shares, because these powerful individuals and groups can influence whether managers keep their jobs or are dismissed (e.g., when they are held accountable for the company’s missing projected profit goals). And many believe the sole purpose of a business is, in fact, to maximize stockholders’ short-term profits. However, considering only stockholders and short-term impacts on them is one of the most common errors business managers make. It is often in the long-term interests of a business *not* to accommodate stockowners alone but rather to take into account a broad array of stakeholders and the long-term and short-term consequences for a course of action.

#### Stakeholders

Stakeholders are individuals, groups, or organizations that have an interest or are affected by the actions and decisions of a company. They include a wide range of parties, such as employees, customers, suppliers, shareholders, communities, government agencies, and advocacy groups. Each stakeholder group has its own interests, expectations, and concerns related to the company's activities, and effective stakeholder management involves identifying, understanding, and addressing these interests to create positive relationships and outcomes.

Some ethical thinkers distinguish shareholder capitalism from what is called stakeholder capitalism, two contrasting approaches to corporate governance and business management. 

**Shareholder capitalism**, traditionally dominant in many Western economies, prioritizes the interests of shareholders above all else, aiming to maximize shareholder value and returns on investment. This model often leads to a focus on short-term profits, cost-cutting measures, and shareholder-centric decision-making, sometimes at the expense of other stakeholders' interests, such as employees, customers, and communities. 

In contrast, **stakeholder capitalism** advocates for a broader view of corporate purpose, recognizing the importance of balancing the interests of all stakeholders, including employees, customers, suppliers, communities, and shareholders. This approach emphasizes long-term sustainability, ethical conduct, and social responsibility, viewing business success as intertwined with the well-being of society and the environment. As debates over corporate governance and social impact continue to evolve, understanding the differences between shareholder and stakeholder capitalism is essential for shaping the future of business and economic systems.

[What is Stakeholder Capitalism? Here's a Definition, and 4 Ways to Make It a Reality][422]

Effective stakeholder management is crucial for the long-term success and sustainability of a company for several reasons. Firstly, stakeholders can significantly impact a company's reputation, brand image, and social license to operate. Positive relationships with stakeholders can enhance trust, loyalty, and goodwill, while negative interactions can lead to reputational damage, boycotts, and regulatory scrutiny. By actively engaging with stakeholders and addressing their concerns, companies can build stronger relationships, mitigate risks, and enhance their reputation in the marketplace.

Secondly, stakeholders often possess valuable knowledge, resources, and expertise that can benefit a company's operations, innovation, and decision-making processes. Employees, for example, may offer insights into workplace culture and productivity, while customers can provide feedback on products and services. By involving stakeholders in decision-making and co-creating solutions, companies can tap into diverse perspectives and harness collective intelligence to drive innovation and improve performance.

Thirdly, effective **stakeholder management** is essential for ensuring alignment between a company's business objectives and societal expectations. In today's interconnected world, companies are increasingly expected to demonstrate social responsibility, environmental stewardship, and ethical conduct. By listening to stakeholders and incorporating their feedback into business strategies, companies can better address societal needs and expectations, enhance their social license to operate, and contribute to sustainable development.

Effective stakeholder management is a strategic imperative for companies seeking to build trust, mitigate risks, drive innovation, and create long-term value for all stakeholders. By recognizing the importance of stakeholder relationships and adopting inclusive and transparent approaches to engagement, companies can foster mutual understanding, collaboration, and shared value, ultimately contributing to their own success and the well-being of society as a whole.

#### Goodwill

> The positive feeling stakeholders have for any particular company is called **goodwill**, which is an important component of almost any business entity, even though it is not directly attributable to the company’s assets and liabilities. Among other intangible assets, goodwill might include the worth of a business’s reputation, the value of its brand name, the intellectual capital and attitude of its workforce, and the loyalty of its established customer base. Even being socially responsible generates goodwill. The ethical behavior of managers will have a positive influence on the value of each of those components. Goodwill cannot be earned or created in a short time, but it can be the key to success and profitability.
> 
> A company’s name, its corporate logo, and its trademark will necessarily increase in value as stakeholders view that company in a more favorable light. A good reputation is essential for success in the modern business world, and with information about the company and its actions readily available via mass media and the Internet (e.g., on public rating sites such as Yelp), management’s values are always subject to scrutiny and open debate. These values affect the environment outside and inside the company. The **corporate culture**, for instance, consists of shared beliefs, values, and behaviors that create the internal or organizational context within which managers and employees interact. Practicing ethical behavior at all levels—from CEO to upper and middle management to general employees—helps cultivate an ethical corporate culture and ethical employee relations.

### 05.04 | Corporate social responsibility and doing well by doing good

In recent years, many businesses have recognized the importance of integrating corporate social responsibility (CSR) into their values and practices, realizing that doing well by doing good is not just a moral imperative but also a strategic advantage. [Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)][429] is the idea that businesses have a duty to serve society as well as their bottom line. It encompasses efforts to create positive social and environmental impact through business activities. Companies like Patagonia and Ben & Jerry's are often cited as examples for their commitment to sustainability, community engagement, and social justice. 

!?[The Business Case for Corporate Social Responsibility][430]

From multinational corporations to startups, companies are adopting sustainable practices, philanthropic initiatives, and ethical supply chain management. One notable example is Patagonia, a renowned outdoor apparel company, which has consistently demonstrated its commitment to environmental sustainability through initiatives like the *1% for the Planet* program. In a counter-intuitive move that expresses their values, Patagonia tells consumers we should buy fewer clothes and demand that they are produced in sustainable ways through our collective power as purchasers. 

> Everything we make has an impact on people and the planet. The clothing industry is one of the worst offenders of labor abuses and the pollution driving the climate crisis, but it doesn’t have to be this way. You have the power to change the way clothes are made. Buy Less, Demand More.

!?[Buy less, demand more][431]

> Sustainability isn't just about being green; it's about ensuring a future for generations to come. 
> 
> -- Yvon Chouinard, Founder of Patagonia

Patagonia shares about their sustainability efforts and the progress they have made toward their goals of producing even more products that are produced in Fair Trade Certified factories and their efforts toward more organically produced fibers through their partnerships with farmers.

Another company with vibrant aspirations toward lower carbon emissions and a reduced, negative environmental impact is Apple. In 2020, Apple made public commitments to "bring its entire carbon footprint to net zero by 2030 — through innovations in materials, clean energy, low-carbon shipping, and restoring natural ecosystems." In 2023, Apple shared about their progress via a playful video in which they talk about their organization's sustainability goals. In this video, they share how Mother Nature is now asking Apple for an update, saying that it had better contain good news. 

!?[2030 Status | Mother Nature | Apple][432]

Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is often talked about in terms of the three Ps: People, Planet, Profit. John Elkington, a British sustainability expert and management consultant, [came up with the expression "triple bottom line"][433] to assess how well companies were doing, not just in terms of their financial performance. CSR encompasses a multifaceted approach to business ethics, with each *P* representing a distinct aspect of CSR, highlighting the interconnectedness between business success and societal well-being.

#### People

At the heart of CSR lies a commitment to people, encompassing employees, customers, communities, and broader society. Businesses that prioritize the *People* aspect of CSR prioritize the well-being and empowerment of their stakeholders. For example, companies may invest in employee development programs, promote diversity and inclusion in the workplace, and support community initiatives aimed at addressing social challenges. 

*Tegu's commitment to address the homelessness problem in Honduras*

Toy business founders Cindy and Chris Haughey started [Tegu][434] to address the problems faced by people in Honduras. The country faces a high unemployment rate, which has contributed to a significant homeless population in Honduras. Tegu is a for-profit business with a mission to provide sustainable income opportunities while combating human trafficking, exploitation, and poverty.

Tegu's core business revolves around producing high-quality wooden toys using sustainably sourced materials. By establishing a manufacturing facility in Honduras, https://tegu.com creates job opportunities for local residents, empowering them with dignified work and a stable income. Through its employment practices, Tegu aims to address the root causes of homelessness and poverty by providing individuals with the means to support themselves and their families.

![Colorful Tegu blocks on the ground in front of a child's feet][image-59]

Chis Haughey [shared on the Ending Human Trafficking Podcast][435] with hosts Dr. Sandie Morgan and Dr. Dave Stachowiak: 

> Tegu does have a larger vision than simply running a profitable company, making some cool toys. The idea really started with experience that I had in Honduras with a ministry in home for street boys. There’s a pretty big street kid population in Honduras and specifically in Tegucigalpa, the capital city. And my initial connection was in 2004 with that home. It led to some relationships being formed as the missionaries working there. Such that when I was back on business in 2006, an idea came up to try and start a for-profit business that would begin to generate jobs and extend the mission of the street boys home so that those boys coming out of the home and others like them would actually have some economic opportunities for themselves to earn a living wage at a purposeful and well-paying job, which is a real need in Honduras. So it really kind of started with an awareness that there are serious social needs. There’s a lot of poverty... one of the biggest impacts that you can have on the society is creating an entrepreneurial business that over time will grow and will employ people as opposed to poor Hondurans without jobs, looking for other means of sustained sustainment for themselves.

Tegu goes beyond job creation by actively collaborating with community organizations and partners to address broader social issues in Honduras. The company works closely with local nonprofits, government agencies, and grassroots initiatives to support education, healthcare, and community development initiatives. By leveraging its resources and network, Tegu contributes to building stronger and more resilient communities, tackling systemic challenges such as poverty, homelessness, and exploitation.

#### Planet

The *Planet* aspect of CSR focuses on environmental sustainability and stewardship. Businesses that recognize the importance of minimizing their environmental footprint, conserving natural resources, and mitigating climate change, are emblematic of sustainable thinking. Companies may adopt renewable energy sources, implement waste reduction strategies, and invest in environmenaly-friendly products and packaging. The [Business as Mission (BAM) organization stresses Creation Care][436] as one of four bottom-lines that they stress in their work. 

*Chop Valve's commitment to sustainability and innovation*

When was the last time you went out for a meal that involved chop sticks? Instead of having used chop sticks go into landfills, Chop Value has other idea. They share on their website about how they are able to [recycle chopsticks from businesses][437], produce new products in [local micro factories][438], and design beautiful products: 

> Our resource is what others may view as waste - that means we don’t take virgin materials from the environment. Every chopstick is perfect, slender, and defect-free, making them ideal to develop an
> innovative engineered material. When designing products, our mindset has been circularity and longevity. This allows us to minimize our environmental impact while creating sustainable solutions engineered to last.

In the industrial manufacturing sector, Chop Value provides us with examples of what it looks like when a company has an unwavering commitment to sustainability and innovation. In Vancouver, alone, more than 100 million chopsticks are thrown out every day. To make each of these chopsticks, they must be processed, harvested, and transported to the place where they will be consumed. 

!?[100m chopsticks recycles... and counting!][439]

Chop Value not only addresses the issue of waste in their business model, but also fosters a culture of sustainability and innovation. They reminds us that every resource, no matter how seemingly insignificant, holds the potential for positive impact when approached with creativity and purpose. 

#### Profit

While CSR emphasizes social and environmental responsibility, businesses must also maintain profitability to ensure long-term viability and sustainability. The *Profit* aspect of CSR acknowledges that financial success is essential for businesses to invest in social and environmental initiatives effectively. However, businesses that prioritize profit over people and the planet risk compromising their ethical integrity and long-term success. It is crucial for businesses to strike a balance between profit and purpose, recognizing that ethical business practices can drive profitability while creating positive social and environmental impact. 

*TOMS Shoes commitment to business being a force to be used for good*

Starting out, TOMS Shoes was known for their uncommon practice of giving a pair of shoes away, each time a pair was purchased by a consumer. Founder Blake Mycoskie traveled to Argentina and discovered that many children were unable to go to school, due to not being able to afford shoes to wear. When he returned from the trip, he came up with the idea to sell shoes, which would in turn allow for a second pair of shoes to be given away. If someone bought a pair today, another pair would be given away tomorrow. [Tomorrow's shoes][440] wouldn't fit, so founder Blake Mycoskie shortened the brand's iconic name to TOMS. 

!?[TOMS founder on one-for-one method: I was bad at math][441]

Much has changed since the company's founding in 2006, though the fundamental mission has remained the same. Amy Smith, TOMS Chief Brand and Impact Officer, describes the importance of this core practice in establishing the values that still guide them today. [She explains][442] how their mission to improve lives has continued since the start, but that it has extended to include a focus on mental health in recent years. 

> Now what it means to "improve lives" has evolved for us. As the pioneers of the One for One® model, we began matching each pair of shoes purchased with a donation of a pair of shoes. A catalyst for the way a great number of brands began to approach business, our example set into motion the importance of improving human lives—socially, environmentally and internally. But mostly, our mission begged us to look inwards at ways we could stretch our impact further and even more effectively.
> 
> Enter mental health. While the world affairs of 2020 put mental health under a direct spotlight, it has been a neglected part of human health for much longer. The mental health crisis touches everyone—with 1 in 8 people in the world experiencing a mental health challenge; and ripples of those mental health challenges impacting all of us.
> 
> At TOMS, we believe every single individual deserves access to quality, affirming mental health care. It's why TOMS has evolved its strategy to give a third of our profits to help support organizations making meaningful mental health strides in their communities.

TOMS Shoes has masterfully integrated social and environmental impact into its business model while maintaining profitability through several key strategies. While this charitable aspect is central to TOMS' brand identity and mission, it also serves as a powerful marketing tool, attracting socially conscious consumers who are willing to pay a premium for products with a purpose. This approach not only drives sales but also enhances brand loyalty and strengthens customer relationships, ultimately contributing to sustained profitability.

TOMS has also diversified its product offerings beyond shoes to include eyewear, apparel, and accessories, allowing the company to reach new markets and appeal to a broader customer base. By expanding its product line while maintaining its commitment to social impact, TOMS has been able to drive revenue growth and increase market share, further bolstering its financial sustainability. They have also prioritized operational efficiency and cost management to ensure that its social and environmental initiatives remain financially viable. The company has implemented supply chain transparency and responsible sourcing practices to minimize costs and reduce environmental impact, while also investing in innovation and technology to streamline operations and improve productivity. 

TOMS Shoes has demonstrated that it is possible to maintain profitability while also prioritizing social and environmental impact. Through its innovative business model, diverse product offerings, operational efficiency, and strategic partnerships, TOMS has successfully balanced purpose and profit, setting a powerful example for businesses seeking to create positive change in the world.

### 05.05 | Ethical leadership

Leaders who embody and promote ethical behavior through their actions and decisions can make a tremendous impact in organizations, in terms of ultimately getting more people to do the right thing, when faced with difficult choices. Ethical leaders are instrumental in shaping an organization's culture and ethical standards. They inspire trust and respect among employees and stakeholders by being transparent, fair, and responsible. Microsoft's CEO, Satya Nadella, emphasizes the importance of fostering a culture of empathy, diversity, and inclusion, where ethical considerations are woven into the fabric of decision-making processes.

> The culture is absolutely core to everything we do at Microsoft. We have to be able to be great listeners, great communicators, and be able to bring out the best in people.
> 
> -- Satya Nadella

Ethical leaders cultivate organizational cultures that prioritize ethical conduct, encourage open communication, and empower employees to speak up against wrongdoing. Ethical leadership in the business world transcends borders, cultures, and societal norms, embodying principles of integrity, inclusivity, and social responsibility. Leaders from historically marginalized populations often bring unique perspectives and transformative approaches to ethical leadership, contributing significantly to their organizations and communities. Here, we explore a few exemplary figures who have made a notable impact through their ethical leadership.

#### Indra Nooyi - Purposeful leadership

Indra Nooyi, the former CEO of PepsiCo, stands out as an example of ethical leadership. Born in India, Nooyi became one of the most powerful women in the business world, leading PepsiCo with a blend of strategic foresight and deep ethical commitment. Under her leadership, PepsiCo not only saw remarkable financial growth but also took significant strides in sustainability and health-conscious product offerings. 

> Leadership is hard to define and good leadership even harder. But if you can get people to follow you to the ends of the earth, you are a great leader. 
> 
> -- Indra Nooyi

Nooyi's leadership style was characterized by her focus on [*Performance with Purpose*][460], aiming to leave a positive imprint on society and the environment while achieving business success. She spearheaded initiatives aimed at minimizing the company's ecological footprint, such as redesigning packaging materials to lessen waste, making strides in water conservation, transitioning to renewable energy sources, and emphasizing recycling practices. By 2020, all company-operated facilities in the U.S. were powered by 100% renewable electricity. 

![Indra Nooyi, smiles at camera][image-60]

Another key aspect of *Performance with Purpose* was fostering a corporate culture that encouraged employee loyalty and retention. For instance, Nooyi personally reached out to the families of her executive team, writing letters to their parents and even visiting their homes. This unique approach was aimed at forging a deeper, more personal connection between the company and its employees, underscoring the human aspect of corporate leadership. Nooyi's journey reflects the challenges and triumphs of leading ethically as a woman of color in a highly competitive industry.

#### Rosalind Brewer - Inclusion

Rosalind Brewer, the former CEO of Walgreens Boots Alliance and former COO of Starbucks, is renowned for her commitment to inclusion in business. As one of the few African American women who has held leadership positions in Fortune 500 companies, Brewer has consistently advocated for racial equality and diversity in the corporate sector. Her leadership was particularly evident during her time at Starbucks, where she played a crucial role in initiating racial bias training for employees, showcasing her commitment to creating an inclusive and ethical corporate culture. 

![Rosalind Brewer looks off camera and smiles][image-61]

In an [interview for Stanford Graduate School of Business View from the Top][461], Brewer shared a key turning point for her in finding her voice. 

> The stress was so high of me trying to be two different people. I could not bear it anymore, I was not myself, and so I just reconciled that I’ve got to bring my whole self to work. And the more that I was like who I am in my day, in my personal life, at work, actually work took off.
> 
> -- Rosalind Brewer

Rosalind Brewer has achieved several groundbreaking firsts, including her roles as CEO of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Group President and COO of Starbucks, and CEO of Sam's Club. Her trailblazing journey has made her one of the most distinguished figures in corporate America, especially [noted by USA Today as a leading woman and one of the most influential Black female executives][462]. Both Forbes and Fortune magazines have celebrated her, naming Brewer among the ranks of the most powerful women in the business world.

#### Paul Polman - Sustainable environmental impact

Another prominent figure known for ethical leadership in their career is Paul Polman, former CEO of Unilever. Polman has been widely recognized for integrating sustainability and ethical practices into the core of Unilever's business strategy. Under his leadership from 2009 to 2019, Unilever set ambitious goals to reduce its environmental footprint and increase its positive social impact through the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan. This plan aimed at decoupling the company's growth from its environmental impact, while increasing its positive social benefits.

![Paul Polman smiles at camera][image-62]

Polman's advocacy for sustainable business practices extended beyond Unilever, as he actively engaged in global discussions on climate change, sustainable development, and responsible capitalism. During his tenure as CEO of Unilever from 2009 to 2019, Paul Polman ambitiously aimed to unlink the company's expansion from its environmental impact while amplifying its positive social contributions through the [Unilever Sustainable Living Plan][463]. Under Polman's guidance, Unilever not only surpassed its competitors in terms of returns but also achieved a performance more than twice that of the FTSE index. Recognizing his exceptional leadership and impact, the Financial Times hailed Polman as one of the most outstanding CEOs of the past decade in 2018.

> Climate change is sometimes misunderstood about being changes in the weather. In reality it is about changes in our very way of life. 
> 
> -- Paul Polman

In 2019, venturing beyond Unilever, Polman, alongside Jeff Seabright (Unilever's former Chief Sustainability Officer) and Kees Kruythoff, launched IMAGINE. This innovative organization is dedicated to assisting businesses in tackling poverty and inequality, as well as combating the urgent threat of climate change. Polman has actively engaged in venture capital, investing in a range of high-profile startups focused on climate solutions and mission-driven objectives. 

Through his relentless advocacy for environmental sustainability, social equity, and responsible business practices, Polman has emerged as a leading global advocate for [conscientious capitalism][464] and sustainable development. He has been a vocal supporter of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and has encouraged other business leaders to prioritize long-term sustainability over short-term profits.

### 05.06 | The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

Many businesses have embraced the [United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)][480] as a guiding framework for their CSR initiatives. These 17 interlinked goals address global challenges such as poverty, inequality, climate change, and environmental degradation. Companies align their activities with specific SDGs, demonstrating a commitment to contributing to broader societal progress.

![SDGs Poster: No poverty, zero hunger, good health and well being, quality education, gender equality, clean water and sanitation, affordability and clean energy, decent work and economic growth, industry, innovation, and infrastructure, reduced inequalities, etc.][image-63]

By integrating the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals into their CSR strategies, businesses play a vital role in advancing sustainable development while simultaneously driving value for shareholders and stakeholders alike. 

#### Sustainable transportation business examples

Let's look at some examples of how BYD is integrating the SDGs into their goals, in the area of transportation. [Sustainable transport][481] plays a pivotal role in addressing global challenges such as climate change, air pollution, [ending energy poverty][482], and urban congestion while contributing to the attainment of several United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). From electric vehicles to public transportation initiatives, businesses and governments are driving towards a more sustainable future through innovative solutions in transportation.

*SDG 7: Affordable and clean energy*

Sustainable transport aligns closely with [SDG 7][483], which aims to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all. Electric vehicles (EVs) have emerged as a key component of sustainable transportation, offering an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional fossil fuel-powered vehicles. Companies like Tesla, Nissan, and BMW are leading the charge in the EV market, developing innovative technologies and infrastructure to accelerate the transition towards clean energy transportation.

> 
> -- John Maeda, Microsoft Vice President of Design and Artificial Intelligence

*SDG 13: Climate action*

Sustainable transport is a key component of [SDG 13][485], which calls for urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts. By transitioning to low-emission vehicles, investing in public transportation infrastructure, and promoting active modes of transport such as walking and cycling, businesses and governments can significantly reduce carbon emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change.

These businesses exemplify how sustainable transportation initiatives contribute to achieving multiple SDGs simultaneously. By providing affordable and clean energy transportation options, promoting sustainable urban mobility, and advancing climate action, these companies play a crucial role in building more resilient, inclusive, and sustainable communities for future generations. Through sustainable transport initiatives, businesses, governments, and non-profit organizations are not only advancing the goals of sustainability but also fostering inclusive, resilient, and thriving communities for generations to come.

#### Equity business examples

In pursuit of a more equitable and inclusive society, it is imperative to address interconnected challenges related to gender equality, decent work, and reduced inequalities. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 5, 8, and 10 collectively underscore the importance of creating empowering and inclusive workplaces where all individuals have equal opportunities to thrive. Through concerted efforts to promote gender equality, foster decent work conditions, and reduce disparities, businesses play a pivotal role in advancing social progress and economic prosperity for all. Let's explore an example from Dr. Iman Abuzeid, a Black female entrepreneur and co-founder of a $1 billion startup aimed at addressing the critical national nursing shortage.

### 05.07 Foster professional ethics in your career

People often remark when taking this class their surprise that the individuals who worked for the businesses that have become well known for their scandals did not do more to protect their own integrity, while doing right by the company and its stakeholders. This section explores ways that you might foster professional ethics in your career, starting with how to increase your likelihood of finding a company that aligns with your values, the role that professional associations can play in shaping the actions of their members, and how your purchases reflect your ethics and integrity. 

In the movie Jerry Maguire, Jerry decides that he has had enough of the mismatch between his values and the ones of the firm. He grabs the goldfish to take it with him and asks who else is joining him. 

!? [Jerry Maguire - who's coming with me?][502]

How do we foster professional ethics in our careers? What does it take to find a good fit and work for a company that aligns with our values? What are the other aspects of being an ethical professional? 

#### Be a Professional with integrity

*The following is a section of Business Ethics, by Stephen M. Byers and Kurt Stanberry, which may be accessed for free on the [Business Ethics website][503].* 

> Ethical professionals work for companies whose values align with their own. How do you evaluate a company to see whether it is a good occupational fit and one that will allow you to live your ethical values every day?

**Finding the right fit**

> Ethics has become a major consideration for young people in their selection of work and career. The following observation about young British workers applies to their counterparts in the United States, as well: “There’s a quiet revolution happening. . . but it’s not about pay, hours or contracts. It’s a coup d’état led by the nation’s young, politically engaged jobseekers who demand employers enshrine values and ethics in their business model, not just profit.”
> 
> Many job seekers want to feel that what they are doing is not just making money but making a difference, that is, contributing to the company in unique ways that reflect their core values, conscience, and personality. They believe an individual has worth beyond his or her immediate work or position. Many modern companies thus try to give greater weight to the human cost of decisions and employee happiness. They know that, according to studies, employees in “companies that work to build and maintain ethical workplace cultures are more financially successful and have more motivated, productive employees.” The decision whether to transfer someone from Boston to Salt Lake City, for instance, would now likely include the employee from the beginning and consider the impact on family members and the employee’s future, in addition to the needs of the company.
> 
> This was not always the case, and there are several reasons for the change. The first is that satisfied employees are more productive and feel greater commitment to the organization. Second, there are more options for job seekers, which gives them more freedom to choose a company for which to work.
> 
> “When we graduate from school, or whenever we are thinking about changing jobs, we are matching three things in deciding on our “vocation”—the job market (Are there jobs and opportunities?), our skills (Do I have the right skills to succeed in a particular job?) and our passions or beliefs (What do I want to do?) [with the concept that] worthwhile work can be found in working in a corporate culture that respects its workers and their personal lives. You may work where management is supportive and workers thrive and advance, but you can also find yourself working in a toxic environment where human dignity is torn down every day and responding to one’s family commitments is regarded as weaknesses.”
> 
> Many business journals report annually on how highly employees rate their work places ([Figure 11.5][504]). For example, you can consult *Fortune’s* annual list of “100 Best Companies to Work For,” which you can search by such factors as diversity, compensation, and paid time off. You can also consult specialized lists such as *Forbes’* “100 Best Workplaces for Women” and *Black Enterprise’s* “50 Best Companies for Diversity.”

![This bar chart is titled “Best U.S. Employers as Ranked by Employees.” The left side lists employers and the bar extends to the right, with a ranking for each company out of 10. From the best ranked company down, the chart shows Costco with 9.58, Google with 9.57, REI with 9.53, Memorial Hermann Health System with 9.45, United States Automobile Association with 9.42, MD Anderson Cancer Center with 9.40, Penn Medicine with 9.34, Mayo Clinic with 9.34, City of Austin with 9.31, and Wegmans Food Markets with 9.30. attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license][image-64]

***Figure*\* **11.5\*\* With insurance coverage for part-time workers, higher-than-industry-average pay, and an overall employee satisfaction rating of 9.58 of a possible 10, Costco is often rated the best large employer to work for by Forbes and Statista.

> A third reason more companies are considering what truly makes employees happy is that even more than loyalty, employees appear to value the freedom and responsibility to act as moral agents in their own lives. A *moral agent* is someone capable of distinguishing right from wrong and willing to be held accountable for his or her choices.
> 
> The exercise of moral agency includes making a judgment about the alignment of personal and corporate conscience. Rather than jumping at the first job offer, moral agents assess whether the values expressed by the organization conform with their own, while recognizing that there is no perfect job. Even the most ethical organizations make mistakes, and even the most corrupt have managers and workers of integrity ([Figure 11.6][505]). This is why the “right fit” is more likely to be a job in which you can grow or that itself will change in a way that allows you to find greater meaning in it.

![This image shows a hand-painted sign that says “Abuse of power comes as no surprise.”][image-65]

***Figure*\* **11.6\*\* Abuse of power may not come as a surprise, but it should not be “business as usual.” A firm should balance profitability with responsibility to society in a way that lifts the communities and neighborhoods of which we are part.

**It’s not about the money—Is it?**

> You may follow a professional vocation that offers low pay or low status but yields nontangible rewards, such as nonprofit work, nursing, or teaching. Or you may find a position that pays a great deal and offers job security but leaves you feeling unhappy or unfulfilled. For some professionals, these might include law, accounting, dentistry, or anything else. The point is that occupations with high compensation and a certain stature do not always infuse their holders with the greatest psychological and emotional rewards, and it is different for each of us. In the best of all worlds, you might embark on a well-paying career that helps others or contributes a much-needed good or service to society. Finding such work is easier said than done, of course, because the aim of most jobs is not to help people find meaning or happiness. Where these do occur, they are often ancillary effects of work, whose real purpose is the profitability without which there would not be any jobs at all.
> 
> Also consider the gap between the purpose of the business and the purpose of the individuals in it. Except in a few startups, these purposes are not identical. Even artists, musicians, and independent practitioners who derive great meaning from their work are not immune to the frustrations over money or career that affect everyone else.
> 
> It has been estimated, however, that [the amount of money needed to be happy is not actually that much, at least by Western standards, although it is well above the poverty line][506]. Most people find themselves somewhere in the middle in terms of satisfaction and pay. Finding the proper balance between the two for *you* is taking a step on the way to your growth as a professional. You will make that assessment not once but throughout your career as you move in and out of jobs. Even if it turns out to be the best decision of your life, the choice to work for a company because of its mission, leadership, or cultural values should be intentional and based on sufficient knowledge of the company and yourself. To be appreciated for your contributions in the workplace, to work with congenial colleagues, or to provide a product or service of which you are proud might rival money as your most intrinsic motivator at work. Studies attest to this and, as professionals of integrity, we must each decide for ourselves how strong a benefit salary alone is in the jobs we select.

**The role of ethical top leadership**

> As you consider your future path, perhaps leading toward a leadership role, keep in mind that perhaps the most effective way ethical behavior is learned in a company is through the modeling of that behavior by senior executives and others in leadership positions. This modeling sets what is known as “tone at the top.” Employees may already have a personal moral code when they join an organization, but when they see key figures in the workplace actually living out the ethical values of the company, they are more likely to follow suit and take ethics seriously. Leaders’ ethical behavior is especially important [in emerging fields like artificial intelligence][507], where questions of safety, bias, misuse of technology, and privacy are raised daily. It is not enough to offer codes of conduct, training, reporting, and review programs, no matter how thorough or sophisticated, if management does not adhere to or promote them. These are tools rather than solutions. The solutions come from leaders using the tools and showing others how to do the same. This takes practice, reinforcement, and collaboration at all levels of an organization. The result will be a culture of ethics that permeates the company from top to bottom.

To learn more about how top leadership can impact the ethics of employees, see the appendix [Profiles in Business Ethics: Contemporary Thought Leaders][508] from the open textbook we have been exploring in this section.

**What where you work says about you**

> Ethics matter not merely because acting unethically will end in a compliance problem or public relations nightmare but because ethics is a way of life, not a hurdle to overcome. Moreover, the benefit of ethical behavior can grow over time so that a company begins to attract other ethical professionals and develops a reputation for honesty, integrity, and dependability. In a globally competitive world, these are not inconsequential factors. In an ethical workplace, employee satisfaction creates more loyalty to the company and morale improves because employees and managers feel they are part of an effort they can be proud of. Business performance picks up in ways ranging from higher earnings per share to increased customer retention to more satisfied employees.
> 
> Consider the net income of two corporations that, as of 2018, have appeared on eleven consecutive annual lists of the world’s most ethical companies as determined by the [Ethisphere Institute][509]. The first is United Parcel Service (UPS), founded in 1907, which earned net income of $4.91 billion in 2017. The second is Xerox, founded in 1906, which earned net income of $195 million in 2017. Notice the staying power of these two companies, as well. Each is more than a century old and has a global presence. 
> 
> Again, employee loyalty, a positive work environment, and strong financial performance are not accidents; they are the result of intentional efforts on the part of leadership and board members who provide ethical vision and a plan for execution to all stakeholders. Ethical business need not be a zero-sum game with winners and losers; it can create situations in which everyone wins. Is there a more attractive environment for those just starting out in their careers? To be part of something profitable, responsible, and individually uplifting justifies all the work required to get there.

### 05. 08 | Our role as a consumers

In today's interconnected global economy, consumers wield significant power to influence business practices and drive positive change through their purchasing decisions. By aligning our values with ethical considerations, we can promote fair labor practices, environmental sustainability, and social responsibility within the business community. Here, we explore various aspects of business ethics and the role of consumers in shaping a more ethical marketplace.

#### Fair Trade: Supporting Ethical Supply Chains
Fair trade initiatives aim to ensure that producers in developing countries receive fair compensation for their labor and goods. By choosing products with fair trade certifications, consumers can support ethical supply chains and contribute to the economic empowerment of marginalized communities. For example, purchasing fair trade coffee, chocolate, or clothing helps combat exploitative labor practices and promotes sustainable development in regions where workers are often vulnerable to exploitation. The benefits of Fairtrade are illustrated in [this video from FairtradeANZ][526]. 

!?[Benefits of Fairtrade][527]

For Christians, buying fair trade products aligns with the principles of social justice, compassion, and stewardship emphasized in our faith. By purchasing fair trade goods, Christians can support ethical supply chains that ensure fair wages and dignified working conditions for workers, many of whom are marginalized and vulnerable to exploitation. Additionally, buying fair trade enables Christians to live out our commitment to loving our neighbors and caring for the least among us, as fair trade initiatives often prioritize the well-being of communities in developing countries. Through conscious consumption choices, Christians can contribute to a more just and equitable world, reflecting the values of fairness, compassion, and solidarity espoused in their faith.

#### Combatting Labor Trafficking: Ethical Sourcing and Supply Chain Transparency
Labor trafficking remains a pervasive issue in many industries, from agriculture to manufacturing. As consumers, we have a responsibility to demand transparency and accountability from companies regarding their sourcing and supply chain practices. By choosing products from companies that prioritize ethical sourcing and supply chain transparency, we can help combat labor trafficking and ensure that workers are treated with dignity and respect. 

!?[Combating human trafficking in supply chains][528]

Combatting labor trafficking, advocating for ethical sourcing, and demanding transparency in supply chains are not just ethical imperatives for Christians, but also can be expressions of our commitment to upholding human dignity and justice. By actively engaging in efforts to combat labor trafficking, Christians can fulfill our mandate to:

> ...seek justice, love mercy, and walk humbly with God.
> 
> -- Micah 6:8

God asks us to stand in solidarity with the oppressed and vulnerable. Prioritizing ethical sourcing and supply chain transparency reflects the Christian call to stewardship, recognizing that all people are created in the image of God and deserving of fair treatment and respect. By demanding accountability and transparency from businesses, Christians can contribute to the creation of a more just and equitable economic system, one that honors the inherent worth and dignity of every individual and ensures that no one is exploited or marginalized in the pursuit of profit.

#### Fair Wages: Supporting Livelihoods and Economic Equity

Fair wages are essential for ensuring that workers can meet their basic needs and enjoy a decent standard of living. As consumers, we can support companies that pay fair wages to their employees and advocate for policies that promote economic equity. By boycotting companies that engage in wage theft or exploitation and supporting businesses that prioritize fair labor practices, we can help create a more equitable and just society.

Pay equity is an essential part of morality... and not just for humans. In a now-famous series of experiments, Frans de Waal paid two monkeys unequally. An innate sense of fairness transcends species and illustrates principles of equity and justice that resonate throughout the animal kingdom.

!?[Two monkeys were paid unequally: excerpt from Frans de Baal's TED talk][529]

As consumers, Christians can play a vital role in promoting fair wages and economic equity by making intentional choices that prioritize the well-being of workers and marginalized communities. Upholding the biblical principle that "the laborer deserves his wages" (Luke 10:7), we can support companies that pay fair wages and provide dignified working conditions for their employees. By choosing products and services from businesses that prioritize fair labor practices, Christians can advocate for economic justice and equity, ensuring that workers receive compensation that enables them to meet their basic needs and support their families. Additionally, Christians can use their purchasing power to advocate for policies that promote economic equity, such as living wage initiatives and support for labor unions. Through conscientious consumption and advocacy efforts, Christians can contribute to the creation of a more just and equitable society where all individuals are valued and empowered to thrive.

#### Ethical Fashion: Resisting the Temptation of Fast Fashion
Fast fashion thrives on low-cost production, rapid turnover, and exploitation of workers and the environment. By opting for sustainable and ethically produced clothing brands, consumers can resist the allure of fast fashion and support companies that prioritize fair labor practices and environmental sustainability. The BBC shares how clothes that we donate with good intent, wind up in landfills and negatively impacting countries in West Africa and other parts of the globe. 

!?[Fast fashion: The dumping ground for unwanted clothes - BBC News][530]

UN Goodwill Ambassador Roberta Annan explains in that clip how the fashion industry wastes 500 billion dollars a year, globally, due to fast fashion. Choosing quality over quantity, embracing slow fashion principles, and advocating for transparency in the fashion industry can help combat the negative impacts of fast fashion on workers and the planet.

Christians can resist the allure of fast fashion by adopting a mindful and intentional approach to consumption rooted in principles of stewardship, simplicity, and ethical responsibility. By prioritizing quality over quantity and embracing the concept of "less is more," Christians can resist the cultural pressure to constantly consume and instead focus on investing in durable, timeless clothing that reflects their values. By choosing clothing that aligns with our values and beliefs, Christians can make a positive impact on both the fashion industry and the planet, embodying the call to live simply, responsibly, and in harmony with God's creation.

#### Empowering Workers' Rights: Recognizing the Negative Impact of Income Inequality
Throughout our nation's history, our laws, institutions, and social norms have played a role in shaping a segmented or dual economy. Examining various historical eras and social movements sheds light on the emergence of an informal economy and the systematic marginalization of numerous groups from the labor market, notably people of color, women, and immigrants. Faced with barriers to entry into the regulated job market, many individuals have resorted to alternative means of earning a livelihood within a parallel informal economy. 

!?[The history of workers' rights | City Rising | KCET][531]

Women of color have historically been on the forefront of the advocacy for workers rights. Historically marginalized and excluded from many quality job opportunities, they have often found themselves performing essential yet arduous work that underpins the economy, all while lacking the protections afforded to other workers. A glaring example of this inequality is seen in the Social Security Act of 1935, which initially excluded domestic workers— a workforce comprised largely of Black women. 

![**The women in this photo are domestic workers hoping to be hired for a day’s work, as captured by Robert McNeill for Fortune magazine.** [Source][532]**: Robert McNeill, Make A Wish (Bronx Slave Market, 170th Street, New York), 1938, Smithsonian American Art Museum.**][image-66]

> Dora Lee Jones helped found the Domestic Workers Union in Harlem in 1934 in defiance of New York City’s “slave markets,” as they were known. With few employment options during the Depression, Black women would gather daily in the morning at certain locations and wait for white middle-class women to hire them, typically for terrible wages. The union called for a minimum wage, overtime, two weeks’ notice for termination – and no window washing. (Workers were regularly asked to perform the dangerous task of cleaning the outside of upper-floor apartment windows.) The DWU eventually affiliated with the predecessor to today’s Service Employees International Union.
> 
> More stories about this movement may be found on the [U.S. Department of Labor Blog: 8 Black Women Labor Leaders You Should Know][533].

Despite facing systemic barriers and discrimination, women of color have been instrumental in advancing the cause of labor rights, championing fairness, dignity, and equality in the workplace for all workers. Through their resilience and activism, they have made significant strides towards creating a more just and equitable society. Unions have historically played a crucial role in advocating for workers' rights, fair wages, and safe working conditions. As consumers, we can support unionized companies and industries by choosing products and services from companies that respect workers' right to organize and bargain collectively. By standing in solidarity with unionized workers and not crossing picket lines during labor disputes, consumers can help strengthen workers' bargaining power and advance social justice.

As Christians, we are called to embody the teachings of Jesus Christ, who advocated for love, compassion, and justice for all. In response to the negative impacts of income inequality, we are called to act with empathy and solidarity towards those who are marginalized and disadvantaged in our society. This may involve advocating for policies that promote economic equity, such as fair wages, affordable housing, and access to education and healthcare for all. Additionally, we can actively support organizations and initiatives that address the root causes of income inequality and work towards systemic change. Through our actions and advocacy, we can strive to create a society where all individuals are valued, respected, and afforded equal opportunities to flourish.

#### Kindness: Acknowledging and Appreciating Essential Workers
Vanguard student Rebekah Robeck felt a call toward kindness strongly back in 2018. A Costa Mesa High School Student at the time, she saw a lack of care and decided to infuse her school with something different. Rebekah and her mom brought pizzas adorned with "Let's be kind to each other" signs adhered to each box. Robeck shares about the kind of care she is talking about as: 

> Kindness, to me, is the way you treat not only the people you know, but also the people you don’t know with the most respect to making that person feel like they matter.
> 
> -- Rebekah Robeck 

![Rebekah Robeck holds Let's Be Kind t-shirt with her mom, both smiling][image-67]

Robeck wants to grow Let's Be Kind to grow around the world, so that communities can work together to change their cultures.  Robeck was awarded the Mayor's Award by Costa Mesa's Mayor Katrina Foley for starting this kindness movement.. 

!?[Costa Mesa Mayor's Award - Rebekah Robeck, Let's Be Kind][534]

While Robeck's Let's Be Kind initiative started in a school context, there are plenty of other contexts that are in desperate need of our collective kindness. Healthcare workers, restaurant staff, and hotel employees have faced unprecedented challenges and risks, providing us with with some of the most fundamental services in our society. We are experiencing a shortage of these types of workers, such as in the nursing workforce, with stress and burnout being a big factor in the not being able to retain nurses ([Tamata & Mohammadnezhad, 2023][535]). In 2023, [nearly 2 million hospitality and leisure jobs were unfilled][536], with workers wanting more flexibility, better benefits, and a more stable job. 

Genesis 2 reveals that work is a foundational part of being human. In fact, if we go back to Genesis 1, we see depictions of an active God who works in creating all of humanity. The act of rest is also modeled for us by God and we are told how vital a sabbath is for our physical and spiritual lives ([John L. Mackay, 2018][537]). "There is nothing better for a man than to enjoy his work," we are told in  Ecclesiastes 3:22, despite the inherent difficulties of work described in other verses in Ecclesiastes. The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops stresses the importance of [the dignity of work and the rights of workers][538]. They urge us to do better, writing that: 

> The economy must serve people, not the other way around. Work is more than a way to make a living; it is a form of continuing participation in God’s creation. If the dignity of work is to be protected, then the basic rights of workers must be respected--the right to productive work, to decent and fair wages, to the organization and joining of unions, to private property, and to economic initiative.

As consumers, we can show kindness and appreciation to these essential workers by respecting safety protocols, tipping generously, and advocating for fair wages and working conditions. By recognizing the value of their labor and expressing gratitude for their service, we can contribute to a culture of dignity, respect, and compassion in the workplace. 

#### Environmental Responsibility: Choosing Sustainable Products and Practices
Environmental sustainability is a critical aspect of business ethics, as companies have a responsibility to minimize their environmental footprint and mitigate climate change. As consumers, we can support companies that prioritize sustainability by choosing products with eco-friendly certifications, reducing waste, and advocating for policies that promote environmental conservation and stewardship.

As stewards of God's creation, Christians are called to be mindful of the impact our actions have on the environment and future generations. Choosing sustainable products and practices aligns with our faith commitment to care for the Earth and all its inhabitants. By opting for environmentally-friendly alternatives, Christians can reduce their ecological footprint, conserve natural resources, and mitigate climate change. This includes supporting companies that prioritize ethical sourcing, fair labor practices, and sustainable manufacturing processes. Additionally, Christians can incorporate habits into our daily lives, such as reducing waste, conserving energy, and supporting local agriculture. Through these actions, Christians demonstrate their reverence for God's creation and contribute to the well-being of the planet and all its inhabitants.

![Katherine Hayhoe leans against a fence made from twigs, smiling with her arms folded][image-68]

One well-known Christian who works for environmental causes is [Katharine Hayhoe][539]. She is an atmospheric scientist and a professor of political science at Texas Tech University, known for her efforts to bridge the gap between scientists and Christians on the issue of climate change. Hayhoe is also the director of the Climate Science Center at Texas Tech University and has been actively involved in raising awareness about climate change through her research, public speaking engagements, and advocacy work. 

!?[Dr. Katherine Hayhoe Teaches Us How to Talk to People Who Don't Believe in Climate Change][540]

As a devout Christian, Hayhoe emphasizes the importance of caring for God's creation and has been instrumental in promoting dialogue and action on environmental issues within Christian communities. She is widely respected for her expertise in climate science and her ability to communicate the urgency of addressing climate change from a Christian perspective.

#### Consider money's role in happiness

Money undoubtedly plays a significant role in people's lives, providing access to basic necessities, opportunities for education and healthcare, and a sense of security. However, research suggests that beyond a certain threshold, increases in income have diminishing returns on happiness and well-being ([Dunn & Norton, 2013][541]). You have probably heard the expression that money can't buy happiness. Michael Norton, Harvard Business School professor, challenges this thinking. His research challenges the way we tend to think about the role money may play in our lives. 

!?[Money can buy happiness][542]

While financial stability can alleviate stress and contribute to overall life satisfaction, material wealth alone does not guarantee happiness. In fact, the pursuit of wealth at the expense of other values, such as relationships, personal growth, and community engagement, can lead to feelings of emptiness and dissatisfaction. 

For Christians, reflections on money's role in our lives as consumers are deeply rooted in spiritual teachings and values. While recognizing the practical importance of financial resources for meeting basic needs and supporting oneself and others, Christians are also mindful of the potential pitfalls of materialism and greed. The Bible warns against the love of money as a root of all kinds of evil (1 Timothy 6:10) and encourages believers to prioritize spiritual wealth and treasures in heaven over earthly possessions (Matthew 6:19-21). Therefore, Christians approach consumerism with a sense of stewardship, recognizing that all material blessings ultimately come from God and are to be used responsibly and in accordance with God's will. By practicing discernment, generosity, and humility in our consumption habits, Christians seek to honor God with their finances and use their resources to advance God's kingdom and promote justice and compassion in the world.

> Our consumer culture is organized against history. There is a depreciation of memory and a ridicule of hope, which means everything must be held in the now, either an urgent now or an eternal now.
> 
> -- Walter Brueggemann

As consumers, our ethical role lies in recognizing the limitations of material possessions in fostering happiness and prioritizing purchases that align with our values and contribute to the well-being of others and the planet. By practicing conscious consumption, supporting ethical and sustainable businesses, and cultivating gratitude and contentment, we can foster a more meaningful and fulfilling relationship with money and contribute to a happier and more equitable society.

Consumers play a pivotal role in shaping the ethical landscape of the business world. By making informed and ethical purchasing decisions, advocating for social and environmental responsibility, and supporting companies that prioritize ethical practices, we can contribute to a more just, equitable, and sustainable future for all.

We started with the good in the last lesson. Now it is time for the bad: those things that are both unethical and illegal (at least under US law). From insider trading to environmental pollution, from sweatshop labor to tax evasion, we confront the harsh realities of profit-driven enterprises that prioritize short-term gains over long-term integrity. We have talked about the grey areas in business ethics often in this class, but let's look more at actions that are more clearly defined as wrong. Few moments in movies capture the essence of unethical behavior as vividly as Gordon Gekko's "Greed is good" speech from the 1987 film "Wall Street." This iconic scene features Gekko, played with charismatic fervor by Michael Douglas, addressing a tense shareholder meeting with a monologue that champions greed as a driving force for progress and success.

### 06.01 Price fixing

When two or more competitors agree to set prices at a certain level, typically higher than what would exist in a competitive market, that is known as price fixing. This collusion restricts competition and harms consumers by artificially inflating prices. Price fixing is illegal under antitrust laws in many countries, including the United States, European Union, and others. It can result in significant fines and penalties for the companies involved, as well as damage to their reputation. Price fixing is distinct from price gouging, which we will look at in the ugly lesson. Both of these manipulation of prices fall under the broad category of profiteering, which is explained by the One Minute Economist in the following video clip:

#### DRAM chips

One example of price fixing occurred in the early 2000s, among major manufacturers of dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) chips. DRAM chips are essential components in computers and electronic devices. During this period, leading companies such as Samsung, Hynix, and Micron were found to have engaged in an illicit price-fixing scheme. An [investigation by the United States Department of Justice (DOJ)][562] uncovered evidence of collusion among these companies to artificially inflate prices and stifle competition in the DRAM market. This manipulation involved the exchange of pricing information and coordination of production levels to maintain higher prices for DRAM chips. As a result, consumers faced artificially inflated prices for essential components, and competitors were unfairly disadvantaged in the marketplace.

In response to these revelations, the DOJ pursued criminal charges against several executives from the implicated companies. Guilty pleas were entered, and substantial fines were imposed, with Samsung agreeing to pay a fine of $300 million—one of the largest antitrust penalties in U.S. history at the time. This case serves as a stark reminder of the detrimental impact of price-fixing practices on consumer welfare and market integrity. It underscores the importance of stringent antitrust enforcement measures to safeguard competition and promote fairness in the marketplace.

#### Auto parts

Another example of price fixing involves the global automotive parts sector. This scandal, uncovered in the early 2010s, became one of the largest antitrust enforcement actions in automotive history. Several manufacturers were found guilty of colluding to set prices for a variety of car parts, including seat belts, radiators, windshield wipers, air conditioning systems, and steering wheels. The collusion affected millions of cars sold by major automakers around the world, leading to inflated prices for both the manufacturers and, ultimately, consumers. Companies involved in this cartel were subjected to hefty fines by regulatory authorities across multiple jurisdictions, including the United States, Europe, and Asia. The U.S. Department of Justice imposed fines totaling over $2.9 billion on various companies, highlighting the extensive nature of the collusion.

The revelation of this price-fixing conspiracy shed light on the pervasive issue of anti-competitive practices in the automotive supply chain. Investigations revealed that executives from these companies met in secret to agree on the prices and bids for automotive parts, manipulating the market to their advantage for years. This not only undermined the principles of free competition but also hurt consumers by driving up costs and limiting choices. The fallout from this scandal prompted a reevaluation of antitrust laws and enforcement mechanisms within the automotive industry, leading to stricter regulations and increased scrutiny of supply chain practices. It served as a stark reminder of the importance of vigilance and integrity in maintaining fair market conditions.

The price-fixing scandals in both the DRAM chips industry and the global automotive parts sector underscore the detrimental impact of anti-competitive practices on markets and consumers alike. These cases, marked by collusion and manipulation by major corporations, highlight the critical need for robust antitrust laws and vigilant enforcement to safeguard the principles of fair competition. The hefty fines and legal repercussions faced by the companies involved serve as a potent reminder of the legal and ethical obligations businesses have towards market integrity. Moreover, these incidents emphasize the importance of transparency and accountability in corporate conduct to prevent such malpractices. As industries continue to evolve with technological advancements and globalization, the lessons learned from these scandals remain relevant, urging both businesses and regulators to ensure that competition remains fair and markets remain dynamic and open, ultimately benefiting consumers and economies at large.

#### The Informant!

I try to avoid sharing clips from movies that I have not seen, but I am about to in this case. [The Informant! (2009)][563] is a dark comedy, based on a true story, as recounted in the nonfiction book [The Informant: A True Story by Kurt Eichenwald][564]. It stars Matt Damon as Mark Whitacre, an executive at the agribusiness giant Archer Daniels Midland (ADM). Whitacre turns whistleblower for the FBI to expose the company's involvement in a global lysine price-fixing conspiracy. As the story unfolds, Whitacre's unreliable nature and his own legal violations complicate the investigation. 

!?[The Informant! Movie clip - price fixing][565]

The examination of price fixing through the lens of real-world scandals involving DRAM chips, the global auto parts industry, and the cinematic portrayal in The Informant! illustrates the pervasive and damaging nature of this illegal practice. These examples underscore the significant impact that collusion and market manipulation can have on economies, businesses, and consumers, highlighting the necessity for stringent regulatory oversight and ethical business conduct.

### 06.02 | Insider trading

Insider trading stands as a prominent example of unethical and illegal conduct within the world of business, striking at the very heart of fair market practices and investor trust. This malpractice involves trading a public company's stock or other securities (such as bonds or stock options) by individuals with access to nonpublic, material information about the company. Such actions not only undermine the integrity of financial markets but also compromise the level playing field that regulations seek to maintain, allowing a select few to profit at the expense of the uninformed majority. Insider trading erodes public confidence in the financial system, making it a focal point of regulatory bodies worldwide. This section delves into the intricacies of insider trading, exploring its implications for business ethics, the regulatory landscape designed to combat it, and the broader impact on corporate governance and public trust.

#### The difficulty of proving insider trading

This video provides a definition of insider trading, along with a discussion of why it can be so difficult to prove. The example of Martha Stewart is given, to illustrate the challenges. 

!?[What is Insider Trading][569]

#### Boiler Room's depiction of "pump and dump" financial schemes

The film Boiler Room (2000) portrays a brokerage firm engaging in pump and dump schemes, which involve artificially inflating the price of stocks owned by the firm (pumping) through false and misleading positive statements, in order to sell off the overvalued shares at a higher price (dumping). Once the operators of the scheme sell their overpriced shares, the prices of the stocks collapse, leaving many investors with significant losses. Such practices are a form of securities fraud and are illegal under U.S. law, specifically violating regulations enforced by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The movie also touches on elements of insider trading, misrepresentation, and manipulation of the market, all of which are against the law and carry serious penalties, including fines and imprisonment for those convicted. 

!?[Boiler Room (2000) Official Trailer][570]

This film revolves around a college dropout who gets a job as a broker for a suburban investment firm, which puts him on the fast track to success. However, he soon discovers the firm's unethical practices, including insider trading. Boiler Room serves as a cautionary tale about the lure of quick wealth and the ethical and legal boundaries crossed in the pursuit of financial gain.

#### Martha Stewart and ImClone Systems

One of the most high-profile cases of insider trading involves Martha Stewart, a prominent businesswoman and media personality, and her dealings with the biopharmaceutical company ImClone Systems. In late 2001, just before the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced its decision to reject ImClone's application for a new cancer drug, Stewart sold nearly 4,000 shares of ImClone stock. This sale was prompted by a tip she received from her broker, who had insider information that the company's CEO was attempting to sell his shares in anticipation of the negative FDA announcement.

Stewart's sale of ImClone stock, based on nonpublic, material information, resulted in her avoiding losses of approximately $45,000. The case against Stewart brought to light the intricate web of relationships and information flow that can lead to insider trading. In 2004, Martha Stewart was convicted of conspiracy, obstruction of an agency proceeding, and making false statements to federal investigators. Although she was not charged with insider trading itself, her case is often cited as a clear example of the unethical use of insider information for personal gain. Stewart's conviction led to a five-month prison sentence, highlighting the severe consequences of engaging in or being connected to insider trading activities.

#### Raj Rajaratnam and the Galleon Group

Raj Rajaratnam, the founder of the Galleon Group, a major hedge fund, was convicted in one of the largest insider trading cases in United States history. Rajaratnam was accused of using confidential information from corporate insiders to make profitable trades in the stock market. The case revealed a network of insiders across various industries, including technology and consulting, who provided Rajaratnam with material, nonpublic information about earnings reports, mergers, and acquisitions.

!?[Scandals Illustrated | Raj Rajaratnman: Insider Trading][571]

The illegal trades made by Rajaratnam and his associates at the Galleon Group generated over $60 million in illicit profits. The investigation into Rajaratnam's activities involved wiretaps, a first in the context of insider trading cases, unveiling the sophisticated methods used to exchange insider information covertly. In 2011, Rajaratnam was convicted on 14 counts of conspiracy and securities fraud, receiving an 11-year prison sentence and being ordered to pay significant fines and forfeitures. This case underscores the systemic nature of insider trading within certain segments of the financial industry and the lengths to which individuals may go to exploit confidential information for financial gains.

!?[Raj Rajaratnam Convicted in inside-trade case][572]

These examples of insider trading illustrate not only the illegal nature of using nonpublic information for trading but also the broader ethical implications for trust and integrity in the financial markets. They serve as cautionary tales for individuals and institutions alike about the importance of adhering to ethical standards and the legal consequences of failing to do so.

### 06.03 | Environmental pollution

Actions taken by businesses can have a profound impact on the natural world and the people who inhabit the communities in which companies are located. This section explores corporate negligence, illegal dumping, regulatory evasion, and the significant repercussions these actions can have on ecosystems and vulnerable populations. 

A pivotal case that brings to light the severity and human cost of environmental pollution is the story of Erin Brockovich, a legal clerk who became instrumental in building a case against the Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) of California in 1993. Brockovich's relentless investigation revealed that PG&E had been contaminating the drinking water of Hinkley, California, with hexavalent chromium, a toxic chemical known to cause cancer. This real-life saga not only exemplifies the devastating health impacts of corporate environmental negligence but also highlights the power of individual activism in holding corporations accountable.

Don't miss the best part of the clip, when the attorney for the other side begins to take a drink of the water they have provided in the conference room. As they take that sip, Erin Brockovich says: 

> By the way, we had that water brought in special for you folks. It came from a well in Hinkley. 
> 
> -- Erin Brockovich

#### Corporate negligence and environmental harm

Let's examine more about the PG&E and Hinkley Groundwater Contamination case. PG&E was found to have contaminated the groundwater of Hinkley, California, with hexavalent chromium, a carcinogenic chemical. The case resulted in a $333 million settlement in 1996, the largest of its kind at that time. This case not only demonstrated the direct health impacts of corporate environmental negligence but also emphasized the power of community action and legal recourse in holding corporations accountable. In the following clip, Erin Brockovich begins listing the negative health consequences experienced by the residents of Hinkley, all of which she is able to communicate without needing to look at any notes. 

!?[Erin Brockovich Movie clip - I thought we were negotiating here?][574]

Corporate negligence in environmental practices often leads to significant harm, affecting ecosystems, human health, and communities, especially those that are most vulnerable. Another case related to corporate negligence arose from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010. Operated by British Petroleum (BP), the offshore drilling rig exploded and sank in the Gulf of Mexico, causing the largest marine oil spill in history. Over 4.9 million barrels of oil flowed into the Gulf, devastating marine life, damaging ecosystems, and harming local economies reliant on tourism and fishing. BP was found guilty of gross negligence and willful misconduct, resulting in penalties exceeding $65 billion.

!?[Deepwater Horizon movie clip 2016][575]

#### Illegal dumping and waste mismanagement

Illegal dumping and waste mismanagement represent severe ethical and environmental challenges, illustrating a blatant disregard for ecological well-being and public health. These practices can have a detrimental impact, with businesses prioritizing cost-saving measures over environmental responsibility, leading to legal repercussions and public outcry.

**Trafigura and the Probo Koala Incident**

One of the most egregious examples of illegal dumping involved Trafigura, a multinational commodity trading company. In 2006, the company chartered the cargo ship Probo Koala, which offloaded toxic waste in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, affecting tens of thousands of residents with its hazardous fumes. The waste contained toxic substances like caustic soda and hydrogen sulfide, leading to widespread health issues and environmental damage. Trafigura faced legal actions and, in 2007, agreed to a settlement with the Ivorian government, paying $198 million without admitting wrongdoing. Further legal challenges in Europe resulted in additional fines and compensation payments.

!?[Ten years later, Ivorian toxic waste victims still demanding justice, compensation][576]

**Love Canal, New York Disaster**

In the late 1970s, Love Canal, a neighborhood in Niagara Falls, New York, became the symbol of the environmental consequences of hazardous waste mismanagement. The area was built on top of a toxic waste dump used by the Hooker Chemical Company (now Occidental Petroleum Corporation) to dispose of over 21,000 tons of chemical waste. The chemicals leached into the ground and contaminated the surrounding environment, leading to health issues among the residents, including birth defects and cancers. The Love Canal incident prompted significant environmental legislation in the United States.

!?[Love Canal - 40 years later][577]

**Waste Management, Inc. and Environmental Violations**

Waste Management, Inc., a leading waste management company in North America, has faced numerous lawsuits and fines related to illegal dumping and environmental violations. In various instances, the company has been accused of mismanaging landfill operations, resulting in groundwater contamination, odor issues, and non-compliance with environmental regulations. These cases highlight the challenges of waste management in urban areas and the importance of adhering to environmental laws to protect communities and natural resources. The Wall Street Journal explains how WM is working to become more sustainable and to make money from these changes: 

!?[The next big Wall Street stock? It's trash | WSJ][578]

These instances of dumping and waste mismanagement exemplify the dire consequences of prioritizing short-term gains over environmental stewardship and ethical responsibility. They serve as a reminder of the importance of rigorous regulatory frameworks, corporate accountability, and public awareness in combating environmental pollution and safeguarding the planet for future generations.

#### Legislation protecting against pollution

> Ideally, all levels of government—local, state, and federal—should work with each other and with private-sector businesses to accomplish a fair and rational balance between their respective roles in maintaining a just society. Rarely does one actor alone solve a problem; more often, it takes either a state-federal or a government-business partnership to make a significant impact on a social or economic challenge. Such partnerships are often quite effective, according to Deloitte, a global consulting and accounting firm.[50][579]
> 
> For example, the federal **Clean Air Act of 1970** gives the EPA nationwide authority, but controlling air **pollution**, which does not recognize borders, also necessitates that state governments play a very significant role in enforcing environmental standards. In turn, about half the states also allow major cities to have their own air quality regulatory programs. “Think globally, act locally” seems to capture the essence of government regulation in air quality. For decades, California has had an air-quality program that not only attempts to comply with mandates in the federal program but also goes a step further to create state-specific rules, such as stricter auto emissions guidelines.
> 
> In another example, in May 2017, the Environment and Natural Resources Division of the U.S. Department of Justice, together with the EPA and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, announced a settlement with Vopak, a Houston energy company, related to air-quality violations by the company.[51 ][580]Both federal and state government agencies had filed actions against Vopak, stating that the company failed to comply with Clean Air Act requirements to properly manage equipment at its on-site wastewater treatment facility, resulting in excess emissions of a variety of hazardous air pollutants, as well as volatile organic compounds, in an area classified as not meeting ground-level ozone standards. Per the settlement terms, the company, at considerable cost, “will install state-of-the art **pollution** controls at the wastewater treatment system and use infrared cameras” to detect otherwise undetectable air **pollution** from its chemical storage tanks. Additionally, Vopak will pay a $2.5 million civil penalty.[52][581]

### 06.04 | Tax evasion

Tax evasion, the illegal non-payment or underpayment of taxes, poses a significant ethical and legal challenge within both corporate and individual contexts. This deliberate act not only undermines the integrity of tax systems but also shifts the financial burden to law-abiding taxpayers and deprives governments of funds necessary for public services. Unlike tax avoidance, which exploits legal loopholes to minimize tax liabilities, tax evasion involves deceitful practices such as underreporting income, inflating deductions, or hiding money in offshore accounts. 

#### Corporate Tax Evasion Examples

**Enron**: Before its collapse in 2001, Enron was involved in numerous aggressive tax evasion strategies, including the use of offshore entities to hide profits and inflate losses. By manipulating financial statements and tax filings, Enron not only deceived investors and regulators but also avoided paying millions in taxes, contributing to its infamous bankruptcy and scandal.

> Isn't there a flaw in the logic of that phrase - speak truth to power? It assumes that power doesn't know the truth. But power knows the truth just as well, if not better, than the powerless know the truth. Enron knows what it's doing. We don't have to tell it what it's doing. We have to tell other people what Enron is doing.
> 
> -- Arundhati Roy

**HSBC Swiss Bank Account Scandal (2015)**: A leaked list of account holders in HSBC's Swiss private banking arm revealed evidence of the bank aiding clients worldwide in concealing assets and evading taxes. The revelations prompted investigations across several countries, shedding light on the widespread issue of using offshore accounts for tax evasion by wealthy individuals and corporations.

#### Individual Tax Evasion Examples

**Wesley Snipes**: The American actor was convicted in 2008 for willful failure to file federal income tax returns. Snipes attempted to evade taxes on millions of dollars of income using fraudulent tax schemes, leading to a three-year prison sentence. This high-profile case underscored the legal consequences of tax evasion and the government's commitment to prosecuting such offenses.

!?[Snipes sentenced to 3 years on tax charges][583]

**Al Capone**: One of the most famous examples of individual tax evasion is that of Al Capone, the notorious gangster who was eventually imprisoned not for his myriad of criminal enterprises, but for evading taxes on his ill-gotten gains. In 1931, Capone was convicted of tax evasion and sentenced to 11 years in federal prison, illustrating that no one, regardless of their power or status, is above the law. HistoryNet offers us this humorous (stylized?) look at how the IRS pinned Capone: 

!?[This week in history: how the IRS pinned notorious gangster Al Capone][584]

Tax evasion raises profound ethical questions about fairness, social responsibility, and the social contract between individuals, corporations, and the state. It erodes trust in the tax system, exacerbates inequality, and places an undue burden on those who pay their fair share. The funds lost to tax evasion could support essential public services such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure, directly impacting societal welfare and development. The fight against tax evasion requires a multifaceted approach, including tighter regulations, international cooperation to close offshore tax havens, and greater transparency in financial reporting. Highlighting these cases of tax evasion serves not only to inform but also to remind individuals and corporations of the legal and ethical imperatives of tax compliance. By fostering a culture of integrity and accountability, societies can work towards more equitable and just tax systems.

### 06: 05 | Whistleblower retaliation

In many jurisdictions, it is illegal for companies to discriminate against or retaliate against whistleblowers who report unethical or illegal activities within their organizations. Whistleblowers play a crucial role in exposing wrongdoing and promoting transparency and accountability in the workplace. Laws such as the **Sarbanes-Oxley Act** in the United States and the Public Interest Disclosure Act in the United Kingdom provide legal protections for whistleblowers, prohibiting employers from taking adverse actions against them for speaking out. In the U.S., the **Occupational Safety and Heath Administration** urges workers to report unsafe or illegal workplace conditions and has a dedicated [Whistleblowers website][588] to inform citizens about their rights and provide resources. 

!?[5 things you should know about whistleblower retaliation][589]

> The act of **whistleblowing**—going to an official government agency and disclosing an employer’s violation of the law—is different from everyday criticism. In fact, whistleblowing is largely viewed as a public service because it helps society reduce bad workplace behavior. Being a whistleblower is not easy, however, and someone inclined to act as one should expect many hurdles. If a whistleblower’s identity becomes known, his or her revelations may amount to career suicide. Even if they keep their job, whistleblowers often are not promoted, and they may face resentment not only from management but also from rank-and-file workers who fear the loss of their own jobs. Whistleblowers may also be blacklisted, making it difficult for them to get a job at a different firm, and all as a result of doing what is ethical.
> 
> Blowing the whistle on your employer is thus a big decision with significant ramifications. However, most employees do not want to cover up unethical or illegal conduct, nor should they. When should employees decide to blow the whistle on their boss or company? Ethicists say it should be done with an appropriate motive—to get the company to comply with the law or to protect potential victims—and not to get revenge on a boss at whom you are angry. Of course, even if an employee has a personal revenge motive, if the company actively is breaking the law, it is still important that the wrongdoing be reported. In any case, knowing when and how to blow the whistle is a challenge for an employee wanting to do the right thing.
> 
> The employee should usually try internal reporting channels first, to disclose the problem to management before going public. Sometimes workers mistakenly identify something as wrongdoing that was not wrongdoing after all. Internal reporting gives management a chance to start an investigation and attempt to rectify the situation. The employee who goes to the government should also have some kind of hard evidence that wrongful actions have occurred; the violation should be serious, and blowing the whistle should have some likelihood of stopping the wrongful act.
>

#### Protections under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970

> Under many federal laws, an employer cannot retaliate by firing, demoting, or taking any other adverse action against workers who report injuries, concerns, or other protected activity. One of the first laws with a specific whistleblower protection provision was the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. Since passage of that law, Congress has expanded whistleblower authority to protect workers who report violations of more than twenty different federal laws across various topics. (There is no all-purpose whistleblower protection; it must be granted by individual statutes.)
> 
> A sample of the specific laws under which whistleblowing employees are protected can be found in the environmental area, where it is in the public interest for employees to report violations of the law to the authorities, which, in turn, helps the average citizen concerned about clean air and water. The Clean Air Act protects any employee reporting air emission violations from area, stationary, and mobile sources from any retaliation for such reporting. The Water Pollution Control Act similarly protects from retaliation any employee who reports alleged violations relating to discharge of pollutants into water.
> 
> Without the help of employees who are “on the ground” and see the violations occur, it could be difficult for government regulators to always find the source of pollution. Even when whistleblowers are not acting completely altruistically, their revelations may still be true and worthy of being brought to the public’s attention. Thus, in such situations, the responsible employee becomes a steward of the public interest, and we all should want whistleblowers to come forward. Yet not all whistleblowers are white knights, and not all their firms are evil dragons worthy of being slain.
> 
> These legal protections typically include safeguards against termination, demotion, harassment, or any other form of retaliation against whistleblowers. Companies found to have engaged in such retaliatory actions can face severe legal consequences, including fines, civil lawsuits, and damage to their reputation. 
>

#### Healthcare industry example

Retaliating against whistleblowers is illegal in the United States, though common. This NBC story about a neurosurgeon's whistleblower complaint illustrates the key challenges often found in these situations. He alleges retaliation from executives at a Florida hospital after voicing concerns about management practices compromising patient care. NBC correspondent Cynthia McFadden investigates the pattern of allegations against HCA-owned hospitals, the largest for-profit hospital chain in the United States.

!?[Whistleblower says he's facing retaliation for speaking out about hospital management][590]

#### Monetary implications

> Blowing the whistle may bring the employee more than just intrinsic ethical rewards; it may also result in cash. The most lucrative law under which employees can blow the whistle is the False Claims Act (FCA), 31 U.S.C. §§ 3729–3733. This legislation was enacted in 1863, during the American Civil War, because Congress was worried that suppliers of goods to the Union Army might cheat the government. The FCA has been amended many times since then, and today it serves as a leading example of a statutory law that remains important after more than 150 years. The FCA provides that any person who knowingly submits false claims to the government must pay a civil penalty for each false claim, plus triple the amount of the government’s damages. The amount of this basic civil penalty is regularly adjusted by the cost of living, and the current penalty range is from $5500 to $11,000.
> 
> More importantly for our discussion, the **qui tam provision** of the law allows private persons (called relators) to file lawsuits for violations of the FCA on behalf of the government and to receive part of any penalty imposed. The person bringing the action is a type of a whistleblower, but one who initiates legal action on his or her own rather than simply reporting it to a government agency. If the government believes it is a worthwhile case and intervenes in the lawsuit, then the relator (whistleblower) is entitled to receive between 15 and 25 percent of the amount the government recovers. If the government thinks winning is a long shot and declines to intervene in the lawsuit, the relator’s share increases to 25 to 30 percent.
> 
> A few whistleblowers have become rich (and famous, thanks to an ABC News story), with awards ranging in the neighborhood of $100 million.[38 ][591]In 2012, a single whistleblower, Bradley Birkenfeld, a former UBS employee, was awarded $104 million by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), making him the most highly rewarded whistleblower in history. Birkenfeld also spent time in prison for participating in the tax fraud he reported. In 2009, ten former Pfizer employees were awarded $102 million for exposing an illegal promotion of prescription medications. John Kopchinski, the original whistleblower and one of the ten, received $50 million. In another case involving the health care company HCA, two employees who blew the whistle on Medicare fraud ended up receiving a combined total of $100 million.
> 
> It is not just the size of the reward that should get your attention but also the amount of money these employees saved taxpayers and/or shareholders. They turned in companies that were cheating the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (affecting taxpayers), the IRS (affecting government revenues), and private health insurance (affecting premiums). The public saved far more than the reward paid to the whistleblowers.
> 
> Incredibly high rewards such as the aforementioned are somewhat unusual, but according to National Whistleblower Center director Stephen Kohn, “Birkenfeld’s and Eckard’s rewards act like advertisements for the U.S. government’s whistleblower programs, which make hundreds of rewards every year.”[39 ][592]The FCA is one of four laws under which whistleblowers can receive a reward; the others are administered by the IRS, the SEC, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Most whistleblowers do not get paid until the lawsuit and all appeals have concluded and the full amount of any monetary penalty has been paid to the government. Many complex cases of business fraud can go on for several years before a verdict is rendered and appealed (or a settlement is reached). An employee whose identity has been disclosed and who has been unofficially blacklisted may not see any reward money for several years.

#### Sherron Watkins and Enron

> Enron is one of the most infamous examples of corporate fraud in U.S. history. The scandal that destroyed the company resulted in approximately $60 billion in lost shareholder value. Sherron Watkins, an officer of the company, discovered the fraud and first went to her boss and mentor, founder and chairperson Ken Lay, to report the suspected accounting and financial irregularities. She was ignored more than once and eventually went to the press with her story. Because she did not go directly to the SEC, Watkins received no whistleblower protection. (The Sarbanes-Oxley Act was not passed until after the Enron scandal. In fact, it was Watkins’s circumstance and Enron’s misdeeds that helped convince Congress to pass the law.[40 ][593])
> 
> Now a respected national speaker on the topic of ethics and employees’ responsibility, Watkins talks about how an employee should handle such situations. “When you’re faced with something that really matters, if you’re silent, you’re starting on the wrong path . . . go against the crowd if need be,” she said in a speech to the National Character and Leadership Symposium, (a seminar to instill leadership and moral qualities in young men and women).
> 
> Watkins talks openly about the risk of being an honest employee, something employees should consider when evaluating what they owe their company, the public, and themselves. “I will never have a job in corporate America again. The minute you speak truth to power and you’re not heard, your career is never the same again.”
> 
> Enron’s corporate leaders dealt with the looming crisis by a combination of blaming others and leaving their employees to fend for themselves. According to Watkins, “Within two weeks of me finding this fraud, [Enron president] Jeff Skilling quit. We did feel like we were on a battleship, and things were not going well, and the captain had just taken a helicopter home. The fall of 2001 was just the bleakest time in my life, because everything I thought was secure was no longer secure.”

#### Risks faced by whistleblowers

> Sometimes employees, including managers, face an ethical dilemma that they seek to address from within rather than becoming a whistleblower. The risk is that they may be ignored or that their speaking up will be held against them. However, companies should want and expect employees to step forward and report wrongdoing to their superiors, and they should support that decision, not punish it. Sallie Krawcheck, a financial industry executive, was not a whistleblower in either the classical or the legal sense.

#### Sallie Krawcheck and Merrill Lynch

> Shortly after Sallie Krawcheck took over as chief of Merrill Lynch’s wealth management division at Bank of America, she discovered that a mutual fund called the Stable Value Fund, a financial product Merrill had sold to customers as an investment for their 401k plans, was not as stable as its name implied. The team at Merrill had made a mistake by managing the fund in a way that assumed a higher risk than was acceptable to its investors, and the fund ended up losing much of its value. Unfortunately, because it was supposed to be a low-risk fund, the people who had invested in it, and who would suffer most from Merrill’s mistakes, were earners of relatively modest incomes, including Walmart employees, who made up the largest group.
> 
> According to Krawcheck, she had two options. Option one was to say tough luck to the Stable Value Fund’s investors, including the Walmart employees, explaining that all investments carry some degree of risk. Option two was to bail out the investors by pouring money into the fund to increase its value. Krawcheck had already been burned once by trying to be ethical. She had been head of CitiGroup’s wealth management division (Smith Barney); in that capacity, she had made a decision to reimburse clients for some of their losses she felt were due to company mistakes. Rather than supporting her decision, however, CitiGroup terminated her, in large part for making the ethical decision rather than the profitable one. Now she was in the same predicament with a new company. Should Krawcheck risk her job again by choosing the ethical act, or should she make a purely financial decision and tell the 401k investors they would have to take the loss?
> 
> Krawcheck began talking to people inside and outside the company to see what they thought. Most told her to just keep her head down and do nothing. One “industry titan” told her there was nothing to be done, that everyone knows stable-value funds are not really stable. Unconvinced, Krawcheck took the problem to Bank of America’s CEO. He agreed to back her up and put company money into the depleted stable-value funds to prop them up.
> 
> Krawcheck opted to be honest and ethical by helping the small investors and felt good about it. “I thought, ethical business was good business,” she says. “It came down to my sense of purpose as well as my sense of my industry’s purpose; it wasn’t about some abstract ethical theorem . . . the answer wasn’t that I got into the business simply to make a lot of money. It was because it was a business that I knew could have a positive impact on clients’ lives.”[41][594]
> 
> But the story does not really have a happy ending. Krawcheck writes that she thought at the time she had done the right thing *and* still had her job, a win/win outcome of a very tough ethical dilemma. However, speaking out did come at a cost. Krawcheck lost some important and powerful allies within the company, and although she did not lose her job at that time, she writes “the political damage was done; when that CEO retired, the clock began ticking down on my time at Bank of America, and before long I was ‘reorganized out’ of that role.”[42][595]

Those are just a couple of examples of well known whistleblowers. To learn from more people's stories, visit the [National Whistleblower Center's Recognizing Whistleblowers webpage][596] established to recognize and honor the role people have played in reporting wrongdoing in this way. By safeguarding whistleblowers from retaliation, the related laws encourage a culture of accountability and integrity within organizations, empowering employees to report wrongdoing without fear of reprisal. 

### 06.06 | Corporate espionage

The practice of illegally acquiring trade secrets or confidential information from competitors, known as corporate espionage, presents a significant ethical quandary in the business world. While companies strive to gain competitive advantages, engaging in espionage undermines trust, distorts market competition, and violates legal standards. Competitive intelligence gathering, when conducted within legal and ethical boundaries, is a legitimate business practice, involving the analysis of publicly available information to inform strategic decisions. However, corporate espionage crosses this ethical and legal divide by resorting to theft, hacking, bribery, or surveillance to access protected or confidential information. Such actions not only breach legal statutes, like the Economic Espionage Act of 1917 in the United States, but also contravene fundamental principles of fairness and integrity in business.

!?[RSA 2020 Cyber Tips - Combating Economic Espionage][597]

The FBI works with American businesses and universities to protect trade secrets and intellectual property against the threats of theft from foreign governments going against U.S. laws and international trade norms. Our country is [estimated to lose $300 billion dollars annually from intellectual property theft][598]. Inside and outside the U.S., the threats posed by corporate espionage are high. 

*True or false?*

Corporate espionage is a legitimate form of competitive intelligence gathering.

[[ ]()] True
[[X]] False

#### High-Profile Cases of Corporate Espionage

Well known cases of corporate espionage serve as reminders of the intense competitive pressures in the global business landscape and the lengths to which companies will go to gain an edge over their rivals. These incidents highlight the ethical and legal challenges inherent in protecting intellectual property and maintaining fair competition. They not only illustrate the strategic importance of corporate secrets but also the critical need for businesses to navigate the fine line between competitive intelligence and unlawful espionage. 

- **Hewlett-Packard and Oracle**: In a notable instance of corporate espionage, HP filed a lawsuit against Oracle after hiring an ex-HP executive, alleging that Oracle used trade secrets and confidential information to compete unfairly. The [lawsuit was settled in 2010][600], and the executive hired by Oracle, Mark Hurd, agreed to protect HP's confidential information, while performing his job functions at Oracle. 
- **Starbucks and Dunkin' Donuts**: Another case involved a [former Starbucks executive who was caught providing confidential product information to Dunkin' Donuts][601]. This breach of trust and unethical behavior led to legal action and highlighted the importance of loyalty and integrity within the corporate sector.
- **General Motors vs. Volkswagen**: In 1993, one of the automotive industry's most notorious cases of corporate espionage unfolded when [General Motors (GM) and its subsidiary, Opel, accused Volkswagen (VW) of industrial espionage][602]. The controversy centered around José Ignacio López de Arriortúa, a top executive who left GM for VW, allegedly taking with him several key employees and sensitive documents related to GM's manufacturing processes and future plans. GM claimed that López and his team used these documents to streamline VW's production, giving the German automaker a competitive edge. 
- **Google Parent Company Alphabet vs Uber**: A more recent example of corporate espionage involves the legal battle between Google's parent company, Alphabet, and Uber over self-driving car technology. In 2017, Alphabet's Waymo sued Uber, alleging that Anthony Levandowski, a former Google engineer and a pioneer in autonomous vehicle technology, had stolen thousands of documents containing trade secrets before leaving to start his own company, which was quickly acquired by Uber. Waymo claimed that Uber used this stolen information to accelerate its own self-driving car technology. The lawsuit was settled in 2018, with Uber agreeing to give Waymo a 0.34% stake in Uber, [valued at approximately $245 million][603], and ensuring that Waymo's confidential information was not incorporated into Uber hardware and software.

These cases illustrate the potential legal repercussions and damage to reputations that can result from engaging in corporate espionage. They emphasize the need for companies to foster a culture of ethical behavior and respect for competitors' intellectual property.

#### How companies navigate  the competitive landscape ethically and legally

Businesses must navigate the competitive landscape with a commitment to ethical principles. Establishing clear guidelines on competitive intelligence gathering, training employees on ethical conduct, and implementing robust security measures to protect one's own intellectual property are essential steps in promoting an ethical business environment. Furthermore, corporations have a responsibility to stakeholders to engage in practices that ensure long-term sustainability and trust, rather than seeking short-term gains through unethical means.

Corporate espionage, with its illegal and immoral undertones, poses significant challenges to the ethical integrity of the business community. It is imperative for companies to distinguish between competitive intelligence and espionage, adhering to legal and ethical standards in their pursuit of market leadership. By fostering a culture of transparency, respect for competition, and ethical conduct, businesses can contribute to a fair and trustworthy corporate ecosystem. This commitment to ethics not only safeguards the company's reputation and legal standing but also upholds the broader values of fairness and integrity that are foundational to a functioning and competitive marketplace.

**End of Lesson 06**

You have reached the end of Lesson 06. It is time to stop reading (for now) and to go on to work on Challenge 06. 

## 07. The ugly

![Course lesson graphic 07][image-70]

In the prior two lessons, we looked at individuals' and businesses' choices that are more clearly ethical ("the good"), and those actions that are illegal ("the bad"). In this lesson, we will explore behaviors that, while technically legal, possess ethical dimensions that are morally questionable or socially harmful ("the ugly").

In the movie, Moneyball (2011), we see an illustration of the dangers of binary thinking. Billy (played by Brad Pitt) attempts to get the group thinking differently than they have about how to pick players. The scouts keep returning to the way they used to determine who to draft.

!?[Moneyball - He gets on base scene][618]

In this lesson, we will recenter ourselves on avoiding this type of thinking, as well as considering various ethical choices that may not be illegal, but also may not be the most moral. 

### 07.01 | Dichotomous Thinking

Way back in the introduction for this class, we also explored how ethical choices are rarely binary. Dichotomous thinking, also known as binary thinking or all-or-nothing thinking, is a cognitive distortion where an individual perceives and interprets situations, people, and events in extreme, either/or categories, without acknowledging the nuances that usually exist. This type of thinking simplifies complex issues into two opposite choices, overlooking the spectrum of possibilities that lie between the extremes. Richard Rohr, a Franciscan friar and theologian has stressed the limitations of this kind of thinking: 

> The **dualistic mind** is essentially binary, either/or thinking. It knows by comparison, opposition, and differentiation. It uses descriptive words like good/evil, pretty/ugly, smart/stupid, not realizing there may be a hundred degrees between the two ends of each spectrum.
> 
> -- Richard Rohr

According to Richard Rohr, the **dualistic mind** does NOT realize that:

[[X]] There may be a hundred degrees between the two ends of each spectrum.
[[ ]()] Good and evil are often clear-cut and easily distinguishable.
[[ ]()] It uses descriptive words like good/evil, pretty/ugly, smart/stupid.
[[ ]()] Comparison, opposition, and differentiation are fundamental to its operation.

#### The dangers of dichotomous thinking

There are many dangers to binary thinking that are important to be aware of, especially in a business context. 

**1. Oversimplification:** Dichotomous thinking fails to capture the complexity of a given context. By reducing complex issues to two categories, it overlooks the nuances and subtleties that are crucial for a comprehensive understanding.

**2. Poor Decision Making:** When individuals engage in binary thinking, they may make decisions based on incomplete or skewed information. This can lead to choices that do not fully address the issue at hand or that neglect important considerations.

**3. Increased Conflict:** Dichotomous thinking can exacerbate conflicts, as it frames discussions in terms of win/lose rather than exploring compromises or alternative solutions that acknowledge and incorporate different perspectives.

**4. Stress and Anxiety:** Individuals who habitually think in dichotomous terms may experience higher levels of stress and anxiety, as they perceive situations in terms of extreme success or failure, without recognizing the value of partial successes or the learning opportunities in setbacks.

In the context of business ethics, dichotomous thinking can be particularly problematic because ethical dilemmas are rarely clear-cut matters of good vs. bad. Business decisions often involve weighing conflicting interests, assessing the impact on various stakeholders, and navigating complex regulatory and moral landscapes. By framing ethical issues in black-and-white terms, individuals may fail to consider important ethical principles, such as fairness, justice, and responsibility, that require a more nuanced understanding. This can lead to unethical decisions that harm the organization, its stakeholders, and society at large.

#### Avoiding Dichotomous Thinking as Christians in Our Work

For Christians, avoiding dichotomous thinking in work and ethical decision-making is important. Brett McCracken talks in this clip about how we can wind up getting too comfortable in our faith, when historically, when being a Christian was challenging, there was more crying out to God in a passionate way. 

!?[Why you should embrace the uncomfortable aspects of Christianity][622]

**1. Embracing Complexity:** The Christian ethical tradition recognizes the complexity of human life and the moral ambiguity that often accompanies decision-making. By avoiding dichotomous thinking, Christians can better navigate these complexities in a way that reflects their values and beliefs.

**2. Reflecting Christian Love and Understanding:** Christianity teaches love, understanding, and compassion. Approaching work and ethical dilemmas with an openness to the full spectrum of possibilities allows Christians to embody these principles more fully, promoting understanding and reconciliation rather than division.

**3. Pursuing Justice and Mercy:** Christian ethics often emphasize the balance between justice and mercy, recognizing that strict adherence to rules (legalism) does not always lead to morally right outcomes. By moving beyond binary thinking, Christians can better seek solutions that are just, compassionate, and reflective of God's grace.

Both in business ethics and in a Christian approach to work, moving beyond dichotomous thinking allows for more ethical, compassionate, and effective decision-making. It encourages a deeper engagement with the complexities of the world and fosters responses that are more aligned with ethical principles and Christian teachings.

What is dichotomous thinking?

[[ ]()] Considering all possible outcomes before making a decision.
[[X]] Viewing situations, people, and events in extreme, either/or categories.
[[ ]()] The ability to think critically under pressure.
[[ ]()] Making decisions based on ethical principles alone.

Which of the following best describes the dangers of dichotomous thinking in a business context?

[[ ]()] It enhances creativity and innovation.
[[ ]()] It leads to more ethical decision-making.
[[X]] It fails to capture the complexity of given contexts and may lead to poor decision-making.
[[ ]()]  It simplifies communication between different departments.

### 07.02 | Conflicts of Interest

A conflict of interest arises when an individual's personal interests or obligations interfere with their ability to make impartial decisions in the best interest of another party, such as their employer, client, or the public. These conflicts can occur in various contexts, including business, law, medicine, and public service, and they can be both actual and perceived. While some conflicts of interest can lead to illegal activities, such as bribery or corruption, many others fall into ethical grey areas that, although not illegal, can still undermine trust, integrity, and good governance.

!?[Conflicts of interest][629]

What is a conflict of interest?

[[ ]()] A legal dispute between two companies.
[[X]] A situation where personal interests interfere with making impartial decisions for another party.
[[ ]()] A disagreement among employees within an organization.
[[ ]()] An ethical dilemma that has a clear right and wrong answer.

#### Dangers of Conflicts of Interest

It is important for us to be aware of the potential for us to possess conflicts of interest, while also remaining cognoscente of the ways other people's conflicting interests may keep them from making good decisions. These dangers include: 

**1. Erosion of Trust:** When conflicts of interest are present, they can erode trust between parties. For example, if a client believes their consultant's recommendations are influenced by personal gain, the client's trust in those recommendations diminishes.

**2. Compromised Decision Making:** Conflicts of interest can lead to decisions that are not in the best interest of the affected party. This can result in suboptimal outcomes, financial loss, or harm to individuals or organizations.

**3. Damage to Reputation:** Individuals or organizations found to be acting under a conflict of interest can suffer significant reputational damage, which can impact their professional relationships and future opportunities.

**4. Legal and Financial Consequences:** While this discussion focuses on non-illegal conflicts, unresolved or improperly managed conflicts can escalate into legal issues, resulting in fines, penalties, or litigation.

How can conflicts of interest damage an organization?

[[ ]()] By improving trust between parties.
[[ ]()] By demonstrating the vital nature of ethical decision-making processes. 
[[X]] By eroding trust and compromising decision-making. 
[[ ]()] By increasing the efficiency of operations. 

In business ethics, conflicts of interest are particularly pertinent because ethical dilemmas often involve balancing diverse interests and obligations. Ethical business practices require transparency, integrity, and accountability, ensuring decisions are made in the best interest of the company and its stakeholders. This includes avoiding situations where personal interests could unduly influence professional decisions, thereby compromising ethical standards. For instance, a manager deciding on a supplier for their company should not choose a family member's business based solely on personal relationships if it does not offer the best value or service compared to competitors.

#### Christians Avoiding Conflicts of Interest

For Christians in the workplace, avoiding conflicts of interest aligns with biblical principles of integrity, honesty, and stewardship. Christians are called to live out their faith in all aspects of life, including work, by acting in ways that reflect God's character and commandments. This means making decisions that are not only legally and ethically sound but also in accordance with Christian values. For example, a Christian business owner might go beyond legal requirements to ensure their business practices do not exploit workers or harm the environment, reflecting a commitment to justice and care for creation.

#### Managing Non-Illegal Conflicts of Interest

To manage conflicts of interest that are not illegal but still pose ethical concerns, individuals and organizations can take several steps:

- **Disclosure:** Transparently disclosing any potential conflicts of interest to all affected parties.
- **Recusal:** Stepping back from decision-making processes where one's impartiality could be compromised.
- **Policies and Procedures:** Implementing organizational policies that identify, manage, and mitigate conflicts of interest, including regular training on these issues.
- **Ethical Leadership:** Cultivating a culture of ethical awareness and integrity where the values of transparency and accountability are prioritized.

Which of the following steps can help manage non-illegal conflicts of interest?

[[ ]()] Ignoring the conflict and hoping it resolves itself.
[[X]] Disclosing any potential conflicts of interest transparently. 
[[ ]()] Prioritizing personal gain over the organization's best interest.
[[ ]()] Avoiding policies and procedures that could reveal conflicts.

In both business and personal conduct, recognizing and addressing conflicts of interest is crucial for maintaining ethical standards and trust. For Christians, navigating these situations with integrity also represents an opportunity to witness to their faith through ethical decision-making and actions that reflect Christian values of honesty, fairness, and concern for others.

### 07.03 | Planned obsolescence

Planned obsolescence represents a deliberate business strategy where products are designed with a limited useful life or are perceived as outdated, compelling consumers to purchase newer models or versions. This approach not only drives continuous demand but also raises significant ethical questions regarding sustainability, consumer rights, and environmental impact. By examining product lifespan, compatibility with new and existing products, the ease of repair and availability of spare parts, alongside the tactics used in advertising and consumer persuasion, we can uncover the multifaceted approaches companies might use to encourage frequent replacements by consumers. Understanding these indicators not only aids consumers in making informed decisions but also fosters a broader discussion on the ethical responsibilities of manufacturers towards sustainability and consumer rights. 

!?[Planned obsolescence? It's gone too far][639]

How countries address the problem of planned obsolescence various greatly. For example, the United States and the European Union (EU) adopt markedly different approaches to addressing planned obsolescence, reflecting their unique regulatory philosophies and priorities around consumer protection and environmental sustainability. 

**The United States' response**

In the U.S., the response to planned obsolescence is predominantly market-driven, with minimal specific regulation targeting this issue. That means that combatting this form of waste relies on *whatever the market will bear*, or the extent to which people will *vote with their purchasing power* and invest in companies that avoid these practices. Consumer protection laws focus on false advertising and product defects rather than directly on planned obsolescence. The assumption is that market competition and consumer preferences for durable products will naturally discourage the practice. However, this approach has been critiqued for not effectively curbing the environmental and consumer impacts of short-lived products.

**The European Union's (EU's) response**

The EU has proactively legislated against planned obsolescence, integrating it into broader environmental and consumer protection efforts. Instead of relying on the market to drive more sustainable practices, the EU has created laws that protect against planned obsolescence. Initiatives like the [Ecodesign Directive][640] and the [Circular Economy Action Plan][641] aim to increase product durability, ease of repair, and overall sustainability. This includes promoting the *right to repair*, intending to extend product lifespans and reduce waste. The EU's strategy represents a more regulatory approach, prioritizing sustainability and the right of consumers to have longer-lasting products.

The contrast between the U.S. and EU outlines differing priorities: the U.S.'s market-led versus the EU's regulation-driven strategies. The EU's actions might inspire global shifts toward sustainable consumption and production, suggesting a potential pathway for others, including the U.S., to follow as global environmental concerns intensify.

How does the European Union address planned obsolescence differently than the United States?

[[ ]()] By relying solely on market forces to discourage the practice.
[[X]] By proactively legislating against planned obsolescence and promoting sustainability.
[[ ]()] The EU has no specific legislation against planned obsolescence.
[[ ]()] There is no difference between the approach used by the EU.

#### The Light Bulb Conspiracy

A documentary that looks at the aspects of planned obsolescence that arose from products as common as the light bulb and innovations like the Apple iPod is [The Light Bulb Conspiracy][645]. From the video's description, we learn that: 

> Once upon a time..... products were made to last. 
> 
> Then, at the beginning of the 1920s, a group of businessmen were struck by the following insight: 'A product that refuses to wear out is a tragedy of business' (1928). Thus Planned Obsolescence was born. Shortly after, the first worldwide cartel was set up expressly to reduce the life span of the incandescent light bulb, a symbol for innovation and bright new ideas, and the first official victim of Planned Obsolescence. 
> 
> During the 1950s, with the birth of the consumer society, the concept took on a whole new meaning, as explained by flamboyant designer Brooks Stevens: 'Planned Obsolescence, the desire to own something a little newer, a little better, a little sooner than is necessary...'. The growth society flourished, everybody had everything, the waste was piling up (preferably far away in illegal dumps in the Third World) - until consumers started rebelling... Can the modern growth society survive without Planned Obsolescence?

#### Product Lifespan

You may have learned about the product lifecycle in a principles of marketing class. Products get introduced into the market, grow in popularity, mature, and eventually decline in demand, leading to withdrawal from the market. The emphasis is typically on understanding and anticipating the changing needs and dynamics at each phase of a product's journey and the role innovation plays in making and marketing a product. In [Death by Design][646], filmmaker Sue Williams strays from emphasizing a products lifecycle and tells of: 

> ...devices that are designed to die.

!?[Death by design][647]

Too often, companies intentionally design products with a short lifespan, to encourage consumers to purchase replacements or upgrades more frequently. This strategy aims to increase sales volume and ensure a continuous market demand by shortening the time between purchases, thereby boosting profits and driving consumer engagement with the latest product versions or models. Products are designed to have a significantly shorter lifespan than what consumers reasonably expect or what could be technically achievable, suggesting an intentional limitation on durability.

#### Compatibility and Updates

Our family's treadmill broke down, which set my husband down a long trail of trying to have us avoid needing to buy a new one. First, he had a repairperson come out, who said that the part that he had been told to order from the company was incompatible with our model and that we would need to get a new base for the entire treadmill desk. He spent all this time trying to determine how to get the bottom part of the treadmill (the part you run on) to be compatible with the desk part on the top. 

Companies can strategically engineer products with proprietary or incompatible components to limit the ability of consumers to use third-party replacements or to repair products themselves, effectively coercing them into purchasing newer versions. For instance, Apple has faced criticism for using proprietary screws on devices, making it difficult for users to perform simple repairs or battery replacements, and for introducing new charging cables with each subsequent iPhone model, rendering older accessories obsolete. Similarly, printer manufacturers like Epson and HP have been reported to employ chips in their cartridges to prevent the use of non-branded or refilled cartridges, compelling consumers to buy original, often pricier, replacements. These practices not only push consumers towards more frequent purchases but also raise concerns about environmental waste and consumer rights, sparking debates and legal scrutiny over the ethical implications of such designed incompatibility. 

#### Repairability and Spare Parts Availability

Many companies intentionally design products in a way that complicates or outright prevents consumers from performing their own repairs, a practice that, while not illegal, raises significant ethical questions. By employing proprietary screws, sealing devices with adhesive, and restricting access to spare parts and repair manuals, these manufacturers limit repair options to authorized service providers, often at a high cost. This approach not only diminishes consumer autonomy and the right to use products to their fullest extent but also contributes to a culture of disposability, exacerbating environmental issues linked to electronic waste. While these tactics may boost short-term profits by driving consumers to purchase new products more frequently, they challenge ethical standards around consumer rights, sustainability, and the broader societal impact of corporate practices.

The *Right to Repair movement* has gained significant momentum in advocating for consumers' ability to repair their own products, challenging manufacturers' restrictive repair policies that often leave users dependent on official service providers or compel them to purchase new products. [The Repair Association][648] is an organization that is working to bring businesses and consumers together to advocate for policies, laws, and standards that protect the rights to repair, especially for those products that contain digital components.  An unexpected focal point of this movement has been the notorious issue with McDonald's ice cream machines, which are frequently out of service due to complex machinery that only certified technicians are permitted to fix. 

!?[The Right to Repair Movement - If You Don’t Know, Now You Know | The Daily Show][649]

Right to repair has highlighted a broader issue affecting various consumer products, from smartphones and laptops to home appliances and vehicles, where manufacturers limit access to repair manuals, spare parts, and tools. The movement seeks to dismantle these barriers, arguing for legislation that would grant consumers and third-party repair shops the right to repair their own goods. By spotlighting everything from fast-food equipment to everyday technology, the Right to Repair movement emphasizes the environmental, economic, and ethical implications of a culture that undervalues product longevity and consumer autonomy. Advocates suggest that consumers should be able to investigate the ease with which a product can be repaired and the availability of spare parts. Products designed to be non-repairable or for which spare parts are scarce or prohibitively expensive may be indicative of planned obsolescence.

Which approach is advocated by the Right to Repair movement?

[[ ]()] Encouraging consumers to purchase new products instead of repairing old ones.
[[X]] Lobbying for legislation that allows consumers and third-party shops to repair products themselves.
[[ ]()] Promoting the use of proprietary components to prevent third-party repairs.
[[ ]()] Supporting manufacturers' rights to repair the products that they manufacture.

Planned obsolescence sits at a contentious crossroads between economic growth and ethical business practices. As awareness of its implications grows, consumers, businesses, and regulators are increasingly questioning its validity as a business model. By critically examining the durability, repairability, and necessity of product updates, stakeholders can better navigate the ethical considerations of this practice. Encouraging a shift towards sustainability, transparency, and respect for consumer rights not only challenges planned obsolescence but also paves the way for more sustainable consumption and production patterns.

Identify the type of planned obsolescence described in each statement:

Now that we have explored planned obsolescence, which is related to how businesses market their products, we will look at other marketing tactics with ethical implications. 

### 07.04 | Marketing Tactics

You probably learned in your principles of marketing class about the 4Ps. Product, price, promotion, and place. We have explored in this lesson a lot about product, as it relates to "the ugly," and pricing, as it relates to "the bad." This section will examine some ethical issues related to the way companies promote their products. These morally questionable or unethical yet legal marketing tactics are worth learning about and considering the complex relationship between consumer protection, corporate profit motives, and ethical boundaries. 

An example of deceptive marketing tactics can be found in the film "The Joneses" (2009), directed by Derrick Borte. The movie stars Demi Moore and David Duchovny as part of a seemingly perfect family that moves into a wealthy suburban neighborhood. However, it's revealed that they are not a real family but employees of a marketing company, living together to subtly market luxury products and lifestyles to their unsuspecting neighbors.

!?[The Joneses' trailer][665]

#### Psychological Manipulation

Some companies use marketing techniques which exploit psychological vulnerabilities, such as fear, anxiety, or social pressure, to encourage purchases. They are criticized as taking advantage of consumers, often without them always being conscious of it. 

> By definition, advertising aims to persuade consumers to buy goods and services, many of which are nonessential. Although consumers have long been encouraged to heed the warning **caveat emptor** (let the buyer beware), it is a valid question whether advertisers have any ethical obligation to rein in the oft-exaggerated claims of their marketing pitches. Most consumers emphatically would agree that they do.
> 
> The award-winning Harvard University economist John Kenneth Galbraith directly addressed this issue in *The Affluent Society*, first published in 1958. In what he depicted as the “the dependence effect,” Galbraith bemoaned the power of corporations to harness wide-ranging advertising strategies, marketing efforts, and sales pitches to influence consumer purchasing decisions.[15 ][666] He asked whether it is possible for a sophisticated advertising campaign to create a demand for a product whose benefits are frivolous at best. If so, is there anything inherently wrong with that? Or are informed consumers themselves responsible for resisting tempting—though misleading—advertising claims and exercising their own best judgment about whether to buy a product that might be successful, not because it deserves to be but simply because of the marketing hype behind it? These questions remain fundamental to the manager’s task of creating ethical advertising campaigns in which truthful content is prioritized over inducing wasteful consumption.
> 
> Psychological appeals form the basis of the most successful ads. Going beyond the standard ad pitch about the product’s advantages, **psychological appeal** try to reach our self-esteem and persuade us that we will feel better about ourselves if we use certain products. If advertising frames the purchase of a popular toy as the act of a loving parent rather than an extravagance, for instance, consumers may buy it not because their child needs it but because it makes them feel good about what generous parents they are. This is how psychological appeals become successful, and when they do work, this often constitutes a victory for the power of psychological persuasion at the expense of ethical truthfulness.

This is Dr. B breaking in here. Please don't tell my father-in-law (who worked for McDonald's corporate for more than 30 years) about what I'm sharing next. McDonald's has been one of the companies who gets criticized for their happy meals and ways they market toward children. Here's an example of one of their advertisements featuring characters from the movie Sing. 

!?[Sing commercial with happy meal][667]

How does this commercial potentially exploit **psychological vulnerabilities** and make use of a **psychological appeal**?

[[ ]()] By suggesting that the Happy Meal is an essential need for children.
[[ ]()] By using the fear of missing out on popular movie toys to encourage purchases.
[[X]] By appealing to parents' desires to make their children happy and be seen as generous.
[[ ]()] By misleading consumers about the nutritional value of the meal.

> Purchases are also affected by our notion of what constitutes a necessity versus a luxury, and that perception often differs across generations. Older consumers today can probably remember when a cell phone was considered a luxury, for instance, rather than a necessity for every schoolchild. On the other hand, many younger consumers consider the purchase of a landline unnecessary, whereas some older people still use a conventional phone as their main or even preferred means of communication. The cars and suburban homes that were once considered essential purchases for every young family are slowly becoming luxuries, replaced, for many millennials, by travel. Generational differences like these are carefully studied by advertisers who are anxious to make use of psychological appeals in their campaigns.
> 
> A consumer craze based on little more than novelty—or, at least, not on necessity or luxury in the conventional sense—is the Pet Rock, a recurring phenomenon that began in 1977. Pet Rocks have been purchased by the millions over the years, despite being nothing more than rocks. During the 2017 holiday shopping season, they retailed at $19.95.[16 ][671]Is this a harmless fad, or a rip-off of gullible consumers who are persuaded it can satisfy a real need? In the annals of marketing, the Pet Rock craze denotes one of the most successful campaigns—still unfolding today, though in subdued fashion—in support of so dubious a product.
> 
> As long as marketers refrain from breaking the law or engaging in outright lies, are they still acting ethically in undertaking influential advertising campaigns that may drive gullible consumers to purchase products with minimal usefulness? Is this simply the free market in operation? In other words, are manufacturers just supplying a product, promoting it, and then seeing whether customers respond positively to it? Or are savvy marketing campaigns exerting too much influence on consumers ill prepared to resist them? Many people have long asked exactly these questions, and we still have arrived at no clear consensus as to how to answer them. Yet it remains an obligation of each new generation of marketers to reflect on these points and, at the very least, establish their convictions about them.

> ![McDonald's doubles advertisement on the side of a building][image-71]
> 
> A second ethical question is how we should expect reasonable people to respond to an avalanche of marketing schemes deliberately intended to separate them from their hard-earned cash. Are consumers obligated to sift through all the messages and ultimately make purchasing decisions in their own best interest? For example, does a perceived “deal” on an unhealthy food option justify the purchase? These questions have no consensus answers, but they underlie any discussion of the point at which sophisticated advertising runs headlong into people’s obligation to take responsibility for the wisdom of their purchases.

What ethical considerations does the marketing of the Pet Rock raise?

[[ ]()] Whether exploiting a novelty item for profit constitutes unethical behavior.
[[ ]()] If marketing a product with no practical use is a form of consumer deception.
[[ ]()] Whether such products genuinely satisfy a customer's need or exploit their gullibility.
[[X]] All of the above.

#### Social media and mobile apps

> Relevant to any discussion of the influence and ethics of advertising is the emergence and dominance of social media, which now serve as the format within which many people most often encounter ads. Kelly Jensen, a digital-marketing consultant, observed that we inhabit a “Digital Era” in which “the internet is arguably the single most influential factor of our culture—transforming the way we view communication, relationships, and even ourselves. Social media platforms have evolved to symbolize the status of both individuals and businesses alike. . . Today, using social media to create brand awareness, drive revenue, engage current customers, and attract new ones isn’t optional anymore. Now it is an absolute ‘must.’”[11][675]
> 
> These are bold claims—as are the claims of some advertising—but Jensen argues convincingly that social media platforms reach many consumers, especially younger ones, who simply cannot be captured by conventional advertising schemes. For those who derive most of the significant information that shapes their lives solely through electronic sources, nothing other than social media–based appeals stands much chance of influencing their purchasing decisions.
> 
> This upending of conventional modes of advertising has begun to change the content of ads dramatically. It certainly presents a new stage on which people as young as their teens increasingly rely for help in choosing what to buy. Many marketers have come to appreciate that if they are not spreading the word about their products and services via an electronic source, many millennials will ignore it.[12][676]
> 
> Undeniably, a digital environment for advertising, selling, and delivering products and services functions as a two-edged sword for business. It provides lightning-quick access to potential customers, but it also opens pathways for sensitive corporate and consumer data to be hacked on an alarming scale. It offers astute companies nearly unlimited capacity to brand themselves positively in the minds of purchasers, but it simultaneously offers a platform for disgruntled stakeholders to assail companies for both legitimate and self-serving reasons.
> 
> Paul A. Argenti, who has taught business communication for many years at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth University, has studied this dilemma. As he put it, “mobile apps have created a new playground for cyber-thieves.”[13 ][677]And consumer advocates and purchasers alike “now use technology to rally together and fuel or escalate a crisis—posing additional challenges for the corporation” in the crosshairs of criticism. Finally, “the proliferation of online blogs and social networking sites has greatly increased the visibility and reach of all current events, not excluding large corporate”[14 ][678]bungling.
> 
> Regardless of the delivery platform, however, any threat that the advertising of unnecessary or harmful products may pose to our autonomy as consumers is complicated by the fact that sometimes we willingly choose to buy goods or services we may not necessarily require. Sometimes we even buy things that have been proven to be harmful to us, such as cigarettes and sugary drinks. Yet we may *desire* these products even if we do not *need* them. If we have the disposable income to make these discretionary purchases, why should we not do so, and why should advertisers not advise us of their availability?

How has the emergence of social media advertising changed the content of ads?

[[ ]()] It has made ads less frequent but more expensive.
[[X]] Ads have become more interactive and tailored to the individual's preferences.
[[ ]()] There is no significant change in the content of ads with social media.
[[ ]()] Ads now focus solely on older generations.

Which of the following is NOT a challenge faced by corporations due to the rise of digital and social media?

[[ ]()] Increased vulnerability to cyber-theft through mobile apps.
[[ ]()] Consumer advocates using technology to escalate crises.
[[X]] The inability to advertise or sell products and services online.
[[ ]()] Greater visibility of corporate mistakes through blogs and social networking sites

Why might consumers willingly choose to buy goods or services they do not necessarily need, according to the excerpt?

[[ ]()] Because these goods or services are always less expensive than essential items.
[[X]] They may desire these products for personal satisfaction, despite knowing they are unnecessary or harmful.
[[ ]()] Consumers are always fully informed about the products they purchase.
[[ ]()] Advertisers use aggressive tactics to force consumers into making purchases.

#### Cause Marketing Deception

Cause marketing deception occurs when businesses misleadingly promote their products or brand as being supportive of or affiliated with social, environmental, or charitable causes, without a genuine commitment or meaningful contribution to those causes. This section scrutinizes the ethical implications of such deceptive practices, revealing how they exploit consumer goodwill and trust for commercial gain. By examining real-world examples and the thin line between authentic cause marketing and its deceptive counterpart, we aim to highlight the importance of transparency, authenticity, and accountability in corporate cause-related initiatives. The discussion encourages readers to critically assess the integrity of corporate cause marketing campaigns, urging a deeper understanding of the consequences of deception on public trust and the genuine needs of the causes involved.

**Greenwashing**

Environmental consciousness is at the forefront of many consumers minds these days. Some corporations have adopted misleading marketing tactics to appear more eco-friendly than they truly are, a practice commonly known as **greenwashing**. This deceptive marketing strategy falsely present products, services, or an overall brand as environmentally friendly, sustainable, or beneficial to the planet. This practice exploits growing consumer concern for environmental issues, leveraging it to gain an unwarranted market advantage. Greenwashing tactics can range from misleading labels and advertising that suggest a product is "green" or "natural," without substantial evidence, to grandiose corporate sustainability declarations that don't reflect the company's actual practices. This misleading information leads consumers to believe they are making environmentally responsible choices when, in fact, their impact may be negligible or even harmful.

!?[Climate Change: What is greenwashing? 🌍🌳 | Newsround][688]

The ethical issues surrounding greenwashing are significant. By obscuring the true environmental impact of their operations and products, companies not only deceive consumers but also detract attention and resources from genuine sustainability efforts. This deception can slow the progress toward environmental sustainability, as it creates confusion about what constitutes a truly environmentally friendly practice or product.

Consumers can guard against greenwashing by:

- **Researching Claims**: Investigate the specifics behind environmental claims made by companies, looking for certifications from reputable third-party organizations.
- **Evaluating Transparency**: Support companies that provide clear, transparent information about their environmental initiatives, including both successes and areas for improvement.
- **Questioning Vagueness**: Be wary of vague or broad claims like "all-natural" or "eco-friendly" without specific, verifiable information to back them up.

As environmental awareness and the demand for sustainable products grow, it's crucial for consumers to critically evaluate companies' environmental claims. Educating oneself on the nuances of greenwashing can empower consumers to make informed decisions that align with genuine sustainability goals. By demanding transparency and holding companies accountable for their environmental impact, consumers play a vital role in fostering a more sustainable and honest marketplace.

**Pinkwashing**

The practice by some companies of promoting products and brands as supportive of breast cancer awareness or research through the use of pink branding or ribbons, without making a significant contribution to the cause is known as pinkwashing. This marketing strategy often seeks to benefit from the positive association with breast cancer advocacy to enhance corporate image and increase sales, while the actual support for cancer research or patients remains minimal or purely symbolic. 

!?[Pinkwashing an issue during Breast Cancer Awareness Month][689]

The core ethical issue with pinkwashing lies in the potential deception of consumers and the exploitation of a sensitive health issue for commercial gain. When companies engage in pinkwashing, they capitalize on consumer goodwill towards supporting breast cancer research and survivor support. However, if a substantial portion of the proceeds does not actually go towards fighting breast cancer, or if the company's practices contradict health-promoting behaviors (such as producing carcinogenic products), it raises questions about the integrity of these marketing campaigns.

Consumers can take several steps to distinguish genuine breast cancer support from pinkwashing:

- **Transparency**: Look for clear information on product packaging or company websites about how much of the purchase price is donated to breast cancer causes and to which organizations the donations are made.
- **Alignment with Corporate Practices**: Assess whether the company's overall business practices align with health promotion and breast cancer prevention, avoiding those whose products or actions undermine public health.
- **Research and Advocacy**: Support companies that have a long-standing commitment to breast cancer research and advocacy, rather than those that only engage in pink-themed marketing during Breast Cancer Awareness Month without meaningful contributions.

Consumer advocacy plays a vital role in combating pinkwashing. By demanding transparency and holding companies accountable for their claims, consumers and advocacy groups can push for more ethical marketing practices. Social media and consumer review platforms offer powerful tools for spreading awareness and sharing information about companies' real contributions to breast cancer causes. While the intention to support breast cancer research and awareness is commendable, pinkwashing undermines the genuine efforts of organizations and individuals committed to the cause. By fostering consumer awareness and advocating for transparency and accountability, it is possible to ensure that support for breast cancer goes beyond the surface level of pink branding. 

**Healthwashing**

In marketing consumer goods, particularly within the food and beverage industry, **healthwashing** has emerged as a pervasive and controversial practice. This strategy involves branding and promoting products as being healthier than they truly are, often by emphasizing certain nutritional benefits while conveniently omitting less favorable health-related information. The allure of appearing health-conscious to consumers drives companies to adopt healthwashing tactics, capitalizing on the growing public interest in wellness and nutrition. However, this practice raises significant ethical questions about consumer deception, informed choice, and the responsibility of manufacturers in contributing to public health. 

Healthwashing is the practice of making a product appear healthier than it really is by highlighting certain health attributes while ignoring less healthy aspects.

[[X]] True
[[ ]()] Falso

Why is healthwashing considered problematic?

[[ ]()] It accurately informs consumers about product ingredients.
[[ ]()] It helps consumers make healthier food choices.
[[X]] It can mislead consumers into thinking a product is healthier than it actually is, impacting their dietary choices.
[[ ]()] It reduces the overall cost of food production.

These questions are designed to test understanding of healthwashing and its implications for consumer behavior and public health, encouraging critical evaluation of marketing practices and product labeling.

As we saw in one of the SIFT exercises in an earlier lesson, tobacco companies have made attempts to rebrand themselves over the years, and to mitigate the negative public perception associated with cigarette smoking and its health impacts. These efforts have evolved from marketing low-tar and "light" cigarettes as healthier alternatives to more recent endeavors involving the promotion of vaping and e-cigarettes as safer or cessation aids. Tobacco companies introduced "light" and "low-tar" cigarettes, claiming these products were less harmful than regular cigarettes. This was part of a broader strategy to appeal to health-conscious smokers concerned about the dangers of smoking. However, studies have shown that these products did not significantly reduce the risk of smoking-related diseases, leading to accusations of misleading consumers about the actual health risks. In the satirical film "Thank You for Smoking," Rob Lowe's character, Jeff Megall, has a conversation about promoting cigarettes in movies. Megall casually dismisses concerns about the health impacts of smoking with the line, "I'm not a doctor." 

!?[Thank You for Smoking (2/5) Movie CLIP - Hollywood Meeting (2005) HD][694]

This film's sharp critique of the tobacco industry's marketing practices, highlights the ethical disconnect between those who promote smoking and the real-world consequences of its use. More recently, the industry has shifted its focus towards vaping and e-cigarettes, marketing these products as modern, cleaner, and a healthier alternative to traditional smoking. Tobacco companies have invested heavily in the development and marketing of these devices, often promoting them as tools for smokers looking to quit traditional cigarettes, despite ongoing debates about their long-term health impacts and effectiveness as cessation aids. One in four high school students and one in ten middle schoolers are now engaged in vaping. This growing trend highlights a concerning disconnect between parental perceptions and the stark reality of adolescent e-cigarette use. The American Cancer society attempts to raise awareness of parents about this public health crisis. 

!?[Not My Kid: Teen Vaping Epidemic][695]

Tobacco companies have also engaged in rebranding efforts that emphasize their commitment to corporate social responsibility (CSR). This includes investing in environmental initiatives, supporting community programs, and funding research into reduced-risk products. Such actions are aimed at improving their corporate image and distancing the company from the negative health associations of their traditional tobacco products. Tobacco companies have actively engaged in legal and regulatory battles to influence how their products are marketed and perceived. They have opposed strict regulation of vaping products, arguing that these offer a safer alternative to cigarettes and can help reduce public health burdens. Simultaneously, they've faced criticism for targeting younger demographics through flavored vaping products, leading to concerns about a new generation becoming addicted to nicotine.

Tobacco companies' attempts to rebrand themselves and dismiss the negative health impacts of smoking reflect a complex interplay of marketing, regulatory influence, and public relations. While they present vaping and e-cigarettes as part of harm reduction strategies, public health authorities and researchers continue to scrutinize these claims, emphasizing the need for comprehensive studies to understand the long-term implications of these products. The ongoing evolution of tobacco industry tactics underscores the critical importance of vigilance and regulation to protect public health.

Healthwashing occurs in other industries beyond tobacco. FDA-approved health claims such as organic, light, natural, and naturally raised don't necessarily mean that the food or beverage is healthy. Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, dean for policy at the Tufts Friedman School cautions us to not fall for these deceptive marketing tactics. He [writes in the Tufts University Health and Nutrition Letter][696]: 

> Overall, a reasonable approach is to use these terms to compare otherwise similar foods—for example, choosing between two pastries, or two breakfast cereals, or two types of pizza, but also look at the ingredients, amounts of salt and added sugar, healthy fats, and fiber. And don’t let these buzz words fool you—better to pick a non-organic piece of fruit than an organic processed fruit roll.”
> 
> -- Dariush Mozaffarian, MD, DrPH, dean for policy at the Friedman School

Looking at the ingredients in foods and beverages can help, as well as identifying the quantity of salt and added sugar. Dr. Mazaffarian also advises us to use common sense and to [take charge of our eating in the following ways][697]: 

> - **Read the ingredient list.** Look for whole grains, fruits, veggies, beans, and nuts as the first few ingredients. Be cautious about long ingredient lists with few terms you recognize.
> - **Use Nutrition Facts.** Look for products with lower sodium and added sugars and higher fiber and healthy fats (total fat minus saturated fat).
> - **Beware of health ‘halos.’** Remember that being organic, gluten-free, no cholesterol, low-fat or fat free, reduced, light, fortified, or natural does not make an unhealthy food a healthy choice.
> - **Watch for hidden added sugars.** Added sugars come in different forms and have many names. Be aware that most sugars are metabolized similarly by your body.
> - **Go for whole and minimally processed.** Foods without labels, like whole fruits and veggies, are the healthiest choices. Also, packaged products with no claims may still be healthy choices.

What is a common tactic used in healthwashing?

[[ ]()] Accurately representing the health benefits of a product.
[[X]] Highlighting a product's low-fat content while ignoring high sugar levels.
[[ ]()] Offering detailed nutritional information that is easy for consumers to understand.
[[ ]()]  Reducing the price of healthy food options.

These unethical behaviors exploit consumers' desire to make socially responsible and environmentally friendly choices, leveraging these values for competitive advantage without genuine commitment. They undermine trust in ethical marketing and highlight the need for consumers to critically assess companies' claims and for regulatory bodies to enforce transparency and accountability in marketing practices.

## 08. Change our mind about changing our minds

![Course lesson graphic 08][image-72]

In business and in our relationships, in general, we all too often privilege those with confidence and immovability in their positions over people with humility and a willingness to change their minds. Consider how much the public degrades their view of politicians who "flip flop" on issues, even when decades have gone by since their first expressed their view on a controversial position. Given how quickly the landscape changes in business, the ability to change our minds is not just a virtue; it's a necessity for ethical leadership. 

Having a commitment to ethical principles that transcend mere compliance with laws or pursuit of profit reflects a posture toward continuous growth and care for the greater good. The ability to change our minds when new information becomes available to us sets us up for having the ability to see the long view and to lead with our values. The ability to continuously learn and grow through humility and vulnerability guides us toward more sustainable business practices and helps us prepare to navigate the ethical challenges of the business world with greater insight, empathy, and integrity.

#### 08.01 | Hit refresh: Empathy and learning as catalysts for organizational change

![Hit Refresh author with book cover][image-73]

Satya Nadella, in his time as the CEO of Microsoft, illustrates the profound impact of empathy and continuous learning in driving organizational change in *Hit Refresh: The Quest to Rediscover Microsoft’s Soul and Imagine a Better Future for Everyone*. Nadella's leadership makes central the needs of both employees and customers, recognizing the importance of a company's mission in achieving sustainable growth.

!?[Hit Refresh, by Satya Nadella - book summary][747]

Under Nadella's leadership, Microsoft embarked on a cultural transformation, prioritizing empathy as a core value and fostering an environment where learning from failure and questioning the status quo are encouraged. Nadella questions how we typically think of empathy and asserts:

> Empathy is not a soft skill. In fact, it's the hardest skill we learn — to relate to the world, to relate to people that matter the most to us.
> 
> -- Satya Nadella

Bloomberg shares an interview with Nadella, where he describes the advice that changed his life. He grew up in India and was told by his parents that he paid too much attention to cricket vs on his studies. He went to graduate school in the U.S. and shifted his educational focus at that time. 

!?[The advice that changed Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella's life][748]

In 1992, Nadella decided to start work at Microsoft, after talking with people who knew of his love of technology and advised him against going into finance. *Hit Refresh* encapsulates three lessons that Nadella learned and applied in transforming Microsoft, each stressing the importance of empathy and learning in business.

**Lesson One: The Role of Empathy in Innovation**
*Fostering an empathetic culture to drive technological advancement and brand loyalty*

The first lesson Nadella shares is the centrality of empathy in the innovation process. By genuinely understanding and sharing the feelings of others, leaders and organizations can better anticipate customer needs and create products that truly make a difference in people's lives. This shift towards empathy not only redefines the approach to product development but also strengthens the connection between a company and its consumers.

Nadella describes the importance of collaboration and empowering people to learn from mistakes and experimentation. Microsoft runs an annual Hackathon, which helps to break down silos in the organization and enable radical collaboration. He stresses that the core of innovation is deep empathy. 

!?[Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella on the Importance of Teamwork and Empathy | Fast Company][749]

**Lesson Two: Learning from Failure**
*Creating a safe space for experimentation and growth*

In *Hit Refresh*, Nadella emphasizes the significance of learning from setbacks and viewing failure as a foundation for growth. He advocates for a culture where mistakes are not stigmatized but are seen as opportunities for learning and improvement. This approach encourages employees to take calculated risks and explore new ideas without the fear of repercussions, leading to greater innovation and adaptability.

> Believe me, my journey has not been a simple journey of progress. There have been many ups and downs, and it is the choices that I made at each of those times that have helped shape what I have achieved.
> 
> -- Satya Nadella

Embracing our failures as much as our successes is crucial to innovation. By creating an environment where experimentation is not just allowed but encouraged, Nadella opens the door to breakthroughs and learning opportunities that drive progress.

**Lesson Three: The Continuous Quest for Knowledge**
*Embracing lifelong learning as a key to personal and organizational success*

The final lesson revolves around the continuous pursuit of knowledge. Nadella argues that in the ever-evolving tech industry, staying relevant requires an unwavering commitment to learning and self-improvement. He encourages leaders and organizations to cultivate curiosity, invest in personal development, and remain open to new ideas and perspectives. This commitment to learning ensures that both individuals and organizations can navigate change effectively and remain competitive. Nadella encourages us to embrace humility as part of an effort toward lifelong learning. He tells us:

> “Don’t be a know-it-all. Be a learn-it-all.”
> 
> -- Satya Nadella

Nadella describes how he facilitated organizational change to transform Microsoft's culture from when Bill Gates and prior CEOs were leading it to where the work culture is today. Nadella's wife had reminded him about the idea of a growth mindset, drawn from the research of Carol Dweck. Those with a fixed mindset believe that their capabilities are innate and that efforts toward improvement will go unrewarded. People with a growth mindset, however, have the perspective that ongoing development is possible, with effort and commitment. Nadella describes the change toward a continuous quest for learning at Microsoft and the ways that "[the learn-it-all does better than the know-it-all][750]."

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" width="512" height="288" src="https://video-api.wsj.com/api-video/player/v3/iframe.html?guid=D8BC205C-D7F5-423E-8A41-0E921E86597C"></iframe>

We can draw lessons from Nadella about the importance of never being done, in terms of our own learning and personal change. Through *Hit Refresh*, Satya Nadella emphasizes the power of empathy and learning in enacting meaningful organizational change. Nadella's leadership philosophy serves as an inspiring model for how businesses can rejuvenate their core, foster innovation, and build a more inclusive and understanding corporate culture. 

**? Review questions | Hit refresh**

Satya Nadella believes that empathy is a soft skill that plays a minor role in business innovation.

#### 08.02 | Think again: The power of knowing what you don't know

![Think Again author and book cover][image-74]

Adam Grant is an organizational psychologist and a leading expert on how we can find motivation and meaning in our lives. In his book *Think Again*, Grant explores the critical art of rethinking: challenging our own beliefs, questioning long-held assumptions, and embracing the flexibility of mind necessary for learning and growth. Too many of us surround ourselves with people who share our same viewpoints, limiting our ability to continuously learn and grow. Grant writes: 

> We listen to views that make us feel good, instead of ideas that make us think hard.
> 
> -- Adam Grant 

!?[Think Again, by Adam Grant - book summary][759]

The book contains three lessons, each of which help us to become lifelong learners and influence others to do the same. In the [Think Again book description][760], we discover that: "We don’t have to believe everything we think or internalize everything we feel. [Think Again] is an invitation to let go of views that are no longer serving us well and prize mental flexibility, humility, and curiosity over foolish consistency. If knowledge is power, knowing what we don’t know is wisdom."

**Lesson one: Updating our own views**
*If you want to be smarter and more likable, admit you don't know things*

In the first lesson of *Think Again*, Adam Grant emphasizes the power of embracing our own ignorance. He argues that admitting we don't know something is not only a stepping stone to acquiring new knowledge but also enhances how others perceive us. By acknowledging our gaps in understanding, we open ourselves up to learning and invite more authentic connections with others, fostering an environment where curiosity and growth are valued over the pretense of knowledge. This lesson challenges the notion that certainty equates to competence, suggesting instead that the willingness to admit what we don't know can make us both smarter and more likable.

**Lesson two: Opening other people's minds**
*Sometimes, even the most ignorant people change their minds*

Adam Grant's second lesson in *Think Again* discusses the transformative potential that lies within all individuals, including those who might initially appear the most stubborn or uninformed. He underscores the idea that change is possible for everyone, emphasizing the importance of creating environments and using approaches that encourage open-mindedness and reflection. This lesson highlights the power of patience, empathy, and strategic communication in facilitating change, even among those who seem most resistant. By understanding the underlying reasons for someone's stance and engaging in thoughtful dialogue, we can pave the way for meaningful shifts in perspective, reinforcing the notion that it's never too late to embrace new ideas and change one's mind.

**Lesson three: Creating communities of lifelong learners**
*If you want to convince people of your perspective, ask them the right questions*

In the third lesson of *Think Again*, Adam Grant describes how to use questions to shift perspectives and foster openness to new ideas. Rather than directly challenging someone's beliefs or presenting counterarguments, Grant asserts that asking questions can lead individuals to reconsider their positions on their own. This approach leverages the natural human inclination for self-reflection and problem-solving, making it more likely for people to arrive at new understandings independently. By engaging in this kind of Socratic questioning (which we saw on such marvelous display when watching the [Michael Sandel Justice videos][761] earlier in the class), we not only respect the autonomy of others but also increase the chances of genuine persuasion, demonstrating that the key to changing minds often lies in the art of inquiry.

**? Review questions | Think again**

For each statement, indicate whether it aligns with Adam Grant's views as presented in *Think Again* (True) or not (False).

- [[True] (False)]
- [    [ ]         [X]     ]  Surrounding ourselves with like-minded individuals enhances our growth.
- [    [X]()     ]  Embracing ignorance is a step toward acquiring new knowledge and enhancing likability.
- [    [ ]         [X]     ]  Certainty should be valued over admitting what we don't know for personal growth.
- [    [X]()     ]  Socratic questioning can lead to genuine persuasion and openness to new ideas.

What does Adam Grant explore in his book *Think Again*?

[[ ]()] The benefits of having a fixed mindset
[[X]] The art of rethinking and questioning assumptions
[[ ]()] Strategies for avoiding change
[[ ]()] Techniques for reducing empathy in communication

What is a key strategy Grant suggests for opening other people's minds?

[[ ]()] Forcing your opinions on others
[[ ]()] Ignoring differing viewpoints
[[X]] Asking the right questions
[[ ]()] Presenting overwhelming evidence

Adam Grant's *Think Again* challenges us to embrace the transformative power of reevaluating our beliefs and cultivating continuous learning and growth. By fostering a culture of curiosity, humility, and empathy, business professionals can cultivate more ethical decision making in organizations.

#### 08.03 | Dare to lead: How vulnerability transforms the way we lead

![Dare to Lead author and book cover][image-75]

Brené Brown, a researcher, professor, and thought leader on vulnerability, courage, empathy, and shame, invites us to explore how embracing our vulnerabilities is the key to deeper connections and a more fulfilling life in her book *Dare to Lead*. Through her research, Brown uncovers the paradox that vulnerability, often seen as a weakness, is actually our greatest strength. She stresses that:

> Vulnerability is not winning or losing; it's having the courage to show up and be seen when we have no control over the outcome.
> 
> -- Brené Brown

!?[You can teach courage][770]

Brown describes the dangers of creating a culture where vulnerability is seen as a weakness. Places where innovation is happening most prominently, risk and reward is stressed, which requires vulnerability in taking risks and embracing failures. *Daring Greatly* challenges us to confront our fears and perceptions about vulnerability. In the [Daring to Lead book description][771], Brown describes how: 

> When we dare to lead, we don’t pretend to have the right answers; we stay curious and ask the right questions. We don’t see power as finite and hoard it; we know that power becomes infinite when we share it with others. We don’t avoid difficult conversations and situations; we lean into vulnerability when it’s necessary to do good work. But daring leadership in a culture defined by scarcity, fear, and uncertainty requires skill-building around traits that are deeply and uniquely human. The irony is that we’re choosing not to invest in developing the hearts and minds of leaders at the exact same time as we’re scrambling to figure out what we have to offer that machines and AI can’t do better and faster. What can we do better? Empathy, connection, and courage, to start.
> 
> -- Brené Brown

**Lesson one: Embracing vulnerability**
*Vulnerability is the birthplace of innovation, creativity, and change*

In this foundational lesson of *Dare to Lead*, Brené Brown champions the embrace of vulnerability as essential to personal growth and connection. She argues that allowing ourselves to be vulnerable opens the door to new possibilities in love, work, and parenting. By shedding the armor that we think protects us, we actually find the strength and courage to create more authentic and meaningful experiences. This challenges the societal notion that to be vulnerable is to be weak, proposing instead that it is the most accurate measure of courage.

In another of Brown's books, *Daring Greatly*, she writes about how much a section of a speech by Theodore Roosevelt resonated with her, as she researched vulnerability. The speech is often referred to as 'the man in the arena,' but is part of a longer talk titled 'Citizenship in a Republic.' Brown shares the section of the speech that is best known: 

> “It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. 
> 
> The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, 
> 
> because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; 
> 
> who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly.…”
> 
> -- Theodore Roosevelt

**Lesson two: Transforming shame into empowerment**
*Understanding and overcoming shame leads to greater self-worth and connection*

Brown describes into the complex emotion of shame and its impact on our ability to be vulnerable. She highlights the importance of recognizing our shame triggers and practicing empathy with ourselves and others as a pathway to resilience. Her research explores the strong correlations between shame and addiction, bullying, aggression, violence, and other behaviors that don't lead to positive outcomes in business, or other aspects of our lives. In this clip, she describes the different ways her research has shown men vs women to experience shame. 

!?[We need to talk about shame | Brené Brown][772]

Guilt, however, doesn't have those same correlations that shame is shown to possess. With guilt, we can be driven to make other choices, or make amends and restore relationships. This second lesson underscores the transformative power of vulnerability in turning feelings of unworthiness into a deep sense of belonging and love, showing that recognizing and confronting our shame can lead to profound changes in how we connect and lead.

**Lesson three: Cultivating a culture of vulnerability**
*Creating environments where vulnerability is encouraged can transform the way we live, love, parent, and lead*

In the third lesson of *Dare to Lead*, Brené Brown explores how fostering environments that celebrate vulnerability can lead to greater innovation and deeper connections within families, workplaces, and communities. She suggests practical strategies for building such cultures, emphasizing the importance of clear communication, setting boundaries, and leading with empathy. By inviting vulnerability, we not only support personal growth but also contribute to building more compassionate and courageous communities.

A key component of developing this type of culture involves establishing genuine empathy in our relationships. Brown describes the difference between empathy and sympathy and how to make the choice to be empathetic toward greater connections with others:

#### 08.04 | Embrace authenticity: Navigate the good, bad, and ugly of professional identity

![Our Separate Ways author and book cover][image-76]

Dr. Ella Bell Smith, a distinguished professor and an expert in organizational behavior, researches professional identity for women in the corporate world, particularly for women of color. Her seminal work, *Our Separate Ways: Black and White Women and the Struggle for Professional Identity*, co-authored with Stella M. Nkomo, examines the challenges and triumphs of women navigating their careers in a business context. Dr. Bell Smith also addresses lessons about authenticity, the confrontation with one's *shadow self*, and the critical role of empathy in leadership and organizational development in her speaking engagements.

**Lesson One: The power of authenticity and its challenges**
*Embracing authenticity in professional environments*

Dr. Bell Smith underscores the importance of authenticity in the workplace, advocating for individuals to bring their whole selves to their professional roles. However, she doesn't shy away from addressing the *bad* or the challenges that come with being authentic, especially for women and minorities who might face stereotypes or biases. Dr. Bell Smith [describes what has motivated her to advocate for greater gender and racial equality][780], which would allow for more people to show up in authentic ways in the workplace. She shares: 

> I think it’s in my DNA. I was adopted, and I get it from all four of my parents. My family is a family who know who they are. My mother and father were very political growing up; my biological father was a third-generation physician, and my biological mother was from a very mixed Irish, Native American, African American family. For an African American woman to be able to say her family knew who they were—that is a privilege, a high privilege. It shapes my voice, my commitment, my determination.
> 
> -- Dr. Ella Bell Smith

Rather than attempt to emulate those in power in organizations, [Dr. Bell Smith suggests][781] that women and those from underrepresented groups "take the reins of their professional lives and career trajectories despite the professional barriers and biases that they may encounter along the way." By researching an organization's commitment to diversity before we take the job, we can increase our ability to find a place where we can thrive. This lesson encourages a reflection on how organizations can create environments that not only allow but celebrate, the diversity of experiences and perspectives that employees bring to their roles.

**Lesson Two: Confronting the shadow Self**
*Acknowledging and learning from our less visible traits*

In her discussions on the *ugly* aspects of professional life, Dr. Bell Smith discusses the *shadow self* – the parts of our identity that we prefer to keep hidden, both from ourselves and others. This lesson involves the critical work of self-examination and growth, recognizing that acknowledging and understanding our shadow selves can lead to greater personal authenticity and effectiveness in leadership. It's a call to explore the depths of our identity to emerge as more empathetic and aware leaders. Listen to Dr. Ella Bell describe how our ugly helped us to learn our faith and to recognize our own power. 

!?[The good, bad and ugly lessons][782]

In [an engagement with the Stanford student community in 2017][783], Dr. Ella Bell Smith emphasized the necessity of self-reflection before and during one's career. She advocates for a journey inward to acknowledge and understand the aspects of ourselves that we often overlook or choose to ignore (the shadow self). This process of self-reflection is akin to confronting our shadow selves—those parts of our identity that remain hidden from our conscious awareness yet significantly influence our behaviors and interactions in the workplace. The shift is to go from shame to an asset-based mindset. It's about recognizing and embracing the full spectrum of our identities, to show up in the fullness of ourselves and seek to allow others to do the same. 

**Lesson Three: Cultivating empathy as a foundation for inclusion**
*Building empathetic connections to foster inclusive workplaces*

Empathy stands at the core of Dr. Bell Smith's teachings, highlighted as the essential trait for leaders striving to create inclusive and supportive organizational cultures. This lesson emphasizes the role of empathy in understanding the diverse experiences of employees, particularly the unique challenges faced by women of color in business. By advocating for a leadership approach grounded in empathy, Dr. Bell Smith inspires organizations to move beyond superficial diversity initiatives to foster genuine connections and equity within the workplace.

Through *Our Separate Ways* and her talks, Dr. Ella Bell Smith offers lessons on navigating the complexities of professional identity with authenticity, confronting our inner challenges, and the indispensable role of empathy in achieving inclusivity in the corporate world. Her insights provide guidance for individuals and businesses committed to fostering diversity, equity, and inclusion in their organizational culture.



#### 08.05 | Be humble: The intersection of resolve and acknowledging excellence in others

![Good to Great author and book cover][image-77]

Jim Collins, an author and researcher, presents a paradigm-changing concept in his seminal work, *Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap... and Others Don't*. Collins introduces the idea of *Level 5 Leadership*, a leadership model that combines an unwavering professional will with a profound personal humility. This duality, according to Collins, is what distinguishes leaders who have successfully transformed good companies into great ones. Collins describes this fifth level of leadership and profiles truly exceptional leaders who possessed this type of humility and to "channel their vision into something bigger than themselves."

!?[Good to Great, by Jim Collins][791]

Collins' research suggests that Level 5 Leaders are characterized by their paradoxical blend of humility and fierce resolve. They are leaders who channel their ego needs away from themselves and into the larger goal of building a great company. It's not that these leaders have no ego or self-interest. Rather, their ego is invested in the goal of building a great company. In speaking with a group of business leaders, Collins asks (and answers) the question:

> How do we build that legion of level five leaders? Find something for which you have so much passion that you are willing to endure the pain. If you really want to [become a level five leader], why don't you really think about how to be useful? 
> 
> -- Jim Collins

*Good to Great* offers us three core lessons derived from the concept of Level 5 Leadership, each designed to cultivate a culture of humility and excellence.

**Lesson One: The Personal Humility of Level 5 Leaders**
*Embracing the paradox of personal humility and professional will*

The first lesson from *Good to Great* emphasizes the importance of personal humility in leadership. Level 5 Leaders do not seek fame, glory, or recognition for their achievements but instead focus on what is best for the organization. This lesson challenges the conventional image of the charismatic, attention-seeking leader, suggesting that humility can be a more powerful driver of organizational success.  Collins writes:

> Level 5 Leaders look out the window to apportion credit to factors outside themselves when things go well (and if they cannot find a specific person or event to give credit to, they credit luck). At the same time, they look in the mirror to apportion responsibility, never blaming bad luck when things go poorly.
> 
> -- Jim Collins

**Lesson Two: The Professional Will to Achieve Greatness**
*Fostering a relentless pursuit of organizational excellence*

In the second lesson, Collins delves into the unwavering resolve of Level 5 Leaders to do whatever it takes to make their companies great, even if it requires difficult decisions that might be unpopular in the short term. This professional will, coupled with humility, enables leaders to confront the brutal facts of their reality, make disciplined decisions, and execute them with precision.

**Lesson Three: Building Enduring Greatness through a Blend of Humility and Will**
*Creating a legacy of excellence that transcends the individual leader*

The final lesson explores how Level 5 Leaders contribute to building companies that achieve and sustain greatness long after they have gone. This enduring impact is attributed to the leader's focus on building strong teams, fostering a culture of discipline, and instilling an ethic of hard work and humility across the organization.

Notice that this lesson isn't talking about leaders as charismatic, necessarily. Collins describes that their research doesn't support that in this short clip:

!?[Jim Collins: Charisma, Schmarisma: Real Leaders are Zealots][792]

Leadership is not personality, he stresses. It isn't about the external stuff, but instead is aligned with the question of why they are in it. Are you trying to do something great? Something that goes well beyond you as the leader. When our efforts to facilitate change go beyond the benefits of ourselves, real, lasting change is possible. 

**? Review questions | Be humble**

For each statement, indicate whether it aligns with Jim Collins' views as presented in *Good to Great* (True) or not (False).

- [[True] (False)]
- [    [ ]         [X]     ]  Level 5 Leaders attribute their success to their charismatic personality.
- [    [ ]         [X]     ]  Level 5 Leaders prioritize personal recognition over the company's success.
- [    [X]()     ]  Humility and a strong professional will are central to Level 5 Leadership.
- [    [X]()     ]  A legacy of excellence is a hallmark of Level 5 Leadership according to Collins.

According to Collins, Level 5 Leadership is characterized by a mix of personal humility and professional will.

[[X]] True
[[ ]()] False

According to Jim Collins, how do Level 5 Leaders typically react when things go well?

[[ ]()] They take all the credit for themselves.
[[X]] They credit external factors or luck.
[[ ]()] They attribute success to financial investments.
[[ ]()] They highlight their personal skills as the sole reason for success.

What does Collins imply is not crucial for leadership?

[[ ]()] Humility
[[ ]()] Professional will
[[X]] Charisma
[[ ]()] Disciplined decisions

Through the lens of Level 5 Leadership, Jim Collins offers a compelling argument for the role of humility in achieving not just good, but great leadership. This framework challenges aspiring leaders to rethink their approach to leadership, underscoring the importance of humility, selflessness, and a strong professional will in creating organizations that stand the test of time.

## 09. The value of inclusion

![Course lesson graphic 09][image-78]

Broadly speaking, the benefits of diversity in the workplace can be explored in terms of better alignment with the business owners' values and because it makes the organization more successful. Businesses can experience greater productivity when employees have higher morale ([Weakliem & Frenkel][802]). A diverse workforce fosters creativity by bringing together individuals from various cultures and backgrounds, offering different perspectives and innovative solutions to problems ([Ability Options][803]; [Harvard Business Review][804]). Cultural diversity allows companies to navigate global nuances better, such as language skills that can enhance workplace relations and business opportunities in different markets. Having people who are different from each other work together helps companies connect with a broader client base by promoting a positive image and increasing market awareness. Businesses with diverse workplaces are perceived as better employers, attracting top talent who seek fair treatment and acceptance of all backgrounds. 

#### 09.01 | Reframing Privilege: Promoting Equality and Equity

I can still remember early in our dating, Dave (my husband) would frequently revisit the same source of humor and lightheartedness. After experiencing one of life's frustrations and grumbling a bit, he would sort of *reset* himself and say, "If that's the worst thing that happens to me today, I think I'm doing okay." 

These reframing opportunities continue to this day, more than 20 years later, and are shared by our entire family. One of us might start to grumble about the traffic on the way to school, or the fact that we forgot to plug the car in the night before and it's not up to its full charge. We might complain about inconveniences that eventually get us chuckling, realizing that things are nowhere near as bad as we believe in that moment. And we'll say sarcastically, "Look at us here. Our lives are so hard, living in Ladera Ranch. Things are tough.  

Our intent is to be people filled with gratitude. Sometimes our privilege gets in the way of that.

Robert Madu Jr, a pastor, husband, and father breaks it down for us all in [a humorous video about what it means when we start complaining about traffic][805]... 



<iframe width="560px" height="320px" allowfullscreen="true" allow="autoplay *" title="God does not inhabit the complaints of His people! " src="https://vanguard.instructuremedia.com/embed/b1977877-269b-440f-82f9-f58629879ea2" frameborder="0"></iframe>



Whenever you start complaining, get yourself a little entitle-mint. "You know who doesn't complain about traffic? People who are walking." Privilege is something that likely all of us reading these words share, just in differing degrees. Proportionally speaking, a lot can be predicted about us based on something as seemingly arbitrary as the zip code in which we were born. 

**How something as simple as a zip code predicts professional advancement**

Recognizing and addressing privilege in a business context is a crucial component of fostering ethical leadership and creating equitable workplaces. The privilege derived from various factors, including the zip code where we were born, significantly influences our professional trajectories and what opportunities are available to us. This phenomenon, deeply embedded in societal structures, extends its impact into the realms of hiring practices, salary negotiations, project assignments, and promotion paths within organizations.

Research has shown that the zip code where one is born and raised can predict significant aspects of their future, even before considering other variables such as education, skills, or personal ambition. This reality points to a deeper systemic issue where geographical and socio-economic backgrounds play a substantial role in determining access to job opportunities. Studies reveal that individuals from affluent zip codes are more likely to be hired for high-paying jobs, receive more substantial starting salaries, and have greater access to career advancement opportunities compared to their counterparts from less privileged areas.

[The Opportunity Atlas][806], developed by the U.S. Census Bureau and Harvard University's Opportunity Insights, analyzes data from 20 million Americans to illustrate how childhood zip codes impact adult success. 

![The Opportunity Altas screenshot][image-79]

 This tool reveals that where individuals grow up influences their social mobility and economic opportunities. It highlights disparities in outcomes based on factors like race, gender, and parents' income levels, emphasizing the impact of neighborhood conditions on life outcomes.

The data from the Opportunity Atlas demonstrates that children from low-income families tend to have poorer-than-average outcomes as adults in nearly every part of the country. It also reveals how societal factors such as education quality, violence, incarceration rates, housing conditions, job access, and healthcare quality play a crucial role in shaping these outcomes. 

**Navigating Privilege in the Workplace**

The acknowledgment of privilege within the workplace is the first step towards mitigating its unintended consequences. Businesses and leaders must critically examine their hiring, promotion, and compensation practices to ensure they are not inadvertently perpetuating inequality. This includes adopting transparent criteria for advancement, implementing bias training programs, and actively seeking to diversify talent pools.

This clip from The Office episode on sensitivity training is a good reminder of how challenging it can be to address these issues in the workplace (not to mention just how bad at it some people can be): 

!?[Sensitivity training - your office][807]

> The following is another excerpt from: Business Ethics | Access for free at https://openstax.org/books/business-ethics/pages/1-introduction 
> 
> Diversity is not simply a box to be checked; rather, it is an approach to business that unites ethical management and high performance. Business leaders in the global economy recognize the benefits of a diverse workforce and see it as an organizational strength, not as a mere slogan or a form of regulatory compliance with the law. They recognize that diversity can enhance performance and drive innovation; conversely, adhering to the traditional business practices of the past can cost them talented employees and loyal customers.
> 
> A study by global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company indicates that businesses with gender and ethnic diversity outperform others. [According to Mike Dillon][808], chief diversity and inclusion officer for PwC in San Francisco, “attracting, retaining and developing a diverse group of professionals stirs innovation and drives growth.” Living this goal means not only recruiting, hiring, and training talent from a wide demographic spectrum but also including all employees in every aspect of the organization.

#### 09.02 | Workplace Diversity

> The twenty-first century workplace features much greater diversity than was common even a couple of generations ago. Individuals who might once have faced employment challenges because of religious beliefs, ability differences, or sexual orientation now regularly join their peers in interview pools and on the job. Each may bring a new outlook and different information to the table; employees can no longer take for granted that their coworkers think the same way they do. This pushes them to question their own assumptions, expand their understanding, and appreciate alternate viewpoints. The result is more creative ideas, approaches, and solutions. Thus, diversity may also enhance corporate decision-making.
> 
> Communicating with those who differ from us may require us to make an extra effort and even change our viewpoint, but it leads to better collaboration and more favorable outcomes overall, [according to David Rock][814], director of the Neuro-Leadership Institute in New York City, who says diverse coworkers “challenge their own and others’ thinking.” According to the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM), organizational diversity now includes more than just racial, gender, and religious differences. It also encompasses different thinking styles and personality types, as well as other factors such as physical and cognitive abilities and sexual orientation, all of which influence the way people perceive the world. “Finding the right mix of individuals to work on teams, and creating the conditions in which they can excel, are key business goals for today’s leaders, given that collaboration has become a paradigm of the twenty-first century workplace,” according to [an SHRM article][815].
> 
> Attracting workers who are not all alike is an important first step in the process of achieving greater diversity. However, managers cannot stop there. Their goals must also encompass **inclusion**, or the engagement of all employees in the corporate culture. “The far bigger challenge is how people interact with each other once they’re on the job,” [says Howard J. Ross][816], founder and chief learning officer at Cook Ross, a consulting firm specializing in diversity. “Diversity is being invited to the party; inclusion is being asked to dance. Diversity is about the ingredients, the mix of people and perspectives. Inclusion is about the container—the place that allows employees to feel they belong, to feel both accepted and different.”
> 
> Workplace diversity is not a new policy idea; its origins date back to at least the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (CRA) or before. Census figures show that women made up less than 29 percent of the civilian workforce when Congress passed Title VII of the CRA prohibiting workplace discrimination. After passage of the law, gender diversity in the workplace expanded significantly. According to the [U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)][817], the percentage of women in the labor force increased from 48 percent in 1977 to a peak of 60 percent in 1999. Over the last five years, the percentage has held relatively steady at 57 percent. Over the past forty years, the total number of women in the labor force has risen from 41 million in 1977 to 71 million in 2017. The BLS projects that the number of women in the U.S. labor force will reach 92 million in 2050 (an increase that far outstrips population growth).
> 
> The statistical data show a similar trend for African American, Asian American, and Hispanic workers. Just before passage of the CRA in 1964, the percentages of minorities in the official on-the-books workforce were relatively small compared with their representation in the total population. In 1966, Asians accounted for just 0.5 percent of private-sector employment, with Hispanics at 2.5 percent and African Americans at 8.2 percent.[6 ][818]However, Hispanic employment numbers have significantly increased since the CRA became law; they are expected to more than double from 15 percent in 2010 to 30 percent of the labor force in 2050. Similarly, Asian Americans are projected to increase their share from 5 to 8 percent between 2010 and 2050.

![This graphic shows four pie charts. Two are titled “Workforce Makeup by Race, 2010 to 2050” and two are titled “Workforce Makeup by Ethnicity, 2010 to 2050.” For workforce makeup by race, the left chart is for 2010 and is broken down into 81 percent White, 12 percent Black, 5 percent Asian, and 2 percent all other.

> Much more progress remains to be made, however. For example, many people think of the technology sector as the workplace of open-minded millennials. Yet Google, as one example of a large and successful company, revealed in its latest diversity statistics that its progress toward a more inclusive workforce may be steady but it is very slow. Men still account for the great majority of employees at the corporation; only about 30 percent are women, and women fill fewer than 20 percent of Google’s technical roles. The company has shown a similar lack of gender diversity in leadership roles, where women hold fewer than 25 percent of positions. Despite modest progress, an ocean-sized gap remains to be narrowed. When it comes to ethnicity, approximately 56 percent of Google employees are White. About 35 percent are Asian, 3.5 percent are Latino, and 2.4 percent are Black, and of the company’s management and leadership roles, 68 percent are held by White people.

![This graphic shows three pie charts and is titled “Google Workforce by Gender.” The chart on the left is “Overall” and is broken down into 69 percent men and 31 percent women. The chart in the middle is “Technology” and is broken down into 80 percent men and 20 percent women. The chart on the right is “Leadership” and is broken down into 75 percent men and 25 percent women.][image-81]

*Google is emblematic of the technology sector, and this graphic shows just how far from equality and diversity the industry remains. (credit: attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)*

> Google is not alone in coming up short on diversity. Recruiting and hiring a diverse workforce has been a challenge for most major technology companies, including Facebook, Apple, and Yahoo (now owned by Verizon); all have reported gender and ethnic shortfalls in their workforces.
> 
> The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has made available 2014 data comparing the participation of women and minorities in the high-technology sector with their participation in U.S. private-sector employment overall, and [the results show][819] the technology sector still lags. Compared with all private-sector industries, the high-technology industry employs a larger share of Whites (68.5%), Asian Americans (14%), and men (64%), and a smaller share of African Americans (7.4%), Latinos (8%), and women (36%). Whites also represent a much higher share of those in the executive category (83.3%), whereas other groups hold a significantly lower share, including African Americans (2%), Latinos (3.1%), and Asian Americans (10.6%). In addition, and perhaps not surprisingly, 80 percent of executives are men and only 20 percent are women. This compares negatively with all other private-sector industries, in which 70 percent of executives are men and 30 percent women.
> 
> Technology companies are generally not trying to hide the problem. Many have been publicly releasing diversity statistics since 2014, and they have been vocal about their intentions to close diversity gaps. More than thirty technology companies, including Intel, Spotify, Lyft, Airbnb, and Pinterest, [each signed a written pledge to increase workforce diversity and inclusion][820], and Google pledged to spend more than $100 million to address diversity issues.
> 
> Diversity and inclusion are positive steps for business organizations, and despite their sometimes slow pace, the majority are moving in the right direction. Diversity strengthens the company’s internal relationships with employees and improves employee morale, as well as its external relationships with customer groups. Communication, a core value of most successful businesses, becomes more effective with a diverse workforce. Performance improves for multiple reasons, not the least of which is that acknowledging diversity and respecting differences is the ethical thing to do.

#### 09.03 | Adding Value through Diversity

> Diversity need not be a financial drag on a company, measured as a cost of compliance with no return on the investment. A recent [McKinsey & Company study][829] concluded that companies that adopt diversity policies do well financially, realizing what is sometimes called a **diversity dividend**. The study results demonstrated a statistically significant relationship of better financial performance from companies with a more diverse leadership team, as indicated in the chart below. Companies in the top 25 percent in terms of gender diversity were 15 percent more likely to post financial returns above their industry median in the United States. Likewise, companies in the top 25 percent of racial and/or ethnic diversity were 35 percent more likely to show returns exceeding their respective industry median.

![This graphic shows two sets of bar graphs titled “Likelihood of Financial Performance above Industry Median by Company Diversity Quartile.” The first set of charts on the left shows “Gender-diverse companies.” The bar on the right shows the first quartile and says 54 on it. The bar on the left shows the fourth quartile and says 47 on it. This section is shorter than the right bar, but above the bar is a section that says plus 15 percent that goes up to the height of the bar on the right. The second set of charts on the right shows “Ethically diverse companies.” The bar on the right shows the first quartile and says 58 on it. The bar on the left shows the fourth quartile and says 43 on it. This section is shorter than the right bar, but above the bar is a section that says plus 35 percent that goes up to the height of the bar on the right.][image-82]

 *Companies with gender and ethnic diversity generally outperform those without it. (credit: attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)*

> These results demonstrate a positive correlation between diversity and performance, rebutting any claim that affirmative action and other such programs are social engineering that constitutes a financial drag on earnings. In fact, the results reveal a negative correlation between performance and lack of diversity, with companies in the bottom 25 percent for gender and ethnicity or race proving to be statistically less likely to achieve above-average financial returns than the average companies. Non-diverse companies were not leaders in performance indicators. Positive correlations do not equal causation, of course, and greater gender and ethnic diversity do not automatically translate into profit. Rather, as this chapter shows, they enhance creativity and decision-making, employee satisfaction, an ethical work environment, and customer goodwill, all of which, in turn, improve operations and boost performance.
> 
> Diversity is not a concept that matters only for the rank-and-file workforce; it makes a difference at all levels of an organization. The [McKinsey & Company study][830], which examined twenty thousand firms in ninety countries, also found that companies in the top 25 percent for executive and/or board diversity had returns on equity more than 50 percent higher than those companies that ranked in the lowest 25 percent. Companies with a higher percentage of female executives tended to be more profitable.
> 
> Achieving equal representation in employment based on demographic data is the ethical thing to do because it represents the essential American ideal of equal opportunity for all. It is a basic assumption of an egalitarian society that all have the same chance without being hindered by immutable characteristics. However, there are also directly relevant business reasons to do it. More diverse companies perform better, as we saw earlier in this chapter, but why? The reasons are intriguing and complex. Among them are that diversity improves a company’s chances of attracting top talent and that considering all points of view may lead to better decision-making. Diversity also improves customer experience and employee satisfaction.
> 
> To achieve improved results, companies need to expand their definition of diversity beyond race and gender. For example, differences in age, experience, and country of residence may result in a more refined global mind-set and cultural fluency, which can help companies succeed in international business. A salesperson may know the language of customers or potential customers from a specific region or country, for example, or a customer service representative may understand the norms of another culture. Diverse product-development teams can grasp what a group of customers may want that is not currently being offered.
> 
> Resorting to the same approaches repeatedly is not likely to result in breakthrough solutions. Diversity, however, provides usefully divergent perspectives on the business challenges companies face. New ideas help solve old problems—another way diversity makes a positive contribution to the bottom line.

#### 09.04 | The Challenges of a Diverse Workforce

> Diversity is not always an instant success; it can sometimes introduce workplace tensions and lead to significant challenges for a business to address. Some employees simply are slow to come around to a greater appreciation of the value of diversity because they may never have considered this perspective before. Others may be prejudiced and consequently attempt to undermine the success of diversity initiatives in general. In 2017, for example, [a senior software engineer’s memo criticizing Google’s diversity initiatives was leaked][843], creating significant protests on social media and adverse publicity in national news outlets. The memo asserted “biological causes” and “men’s higher drive for status” to account for women’s unequal representation in Google’s technology departments and leadership.

![shadowy figure walking in front of a building with the Google logo on it - Jeff Chiu/Associated Press][image-83]

> Google’s response was quick. The engineer was fired, and [statements were released emphasizing the company’s commitment to diversity][844]. Although Google was applauded for its quick response, however, some argued that an employee should be free to express personal opinions without punishment (despite the fact that there is no right of free speech while at work in the private sector). ...The fired engineer and a coworker [then] [filed a class-action lawsuit](http://money.cnn.com/2018/01/08/technology/james-damore-google-lawsuit/index.html) against Google on behalf of three specific groups of employees who claim they have been discriminated against by Google: Whites, conservatives, and men.
> 
> This is not just the standard “reverse discrimination” lawsuit; it goes to the heart of the culture of diversity and one of its greatest challenges for management—the backlash against change.
> 
> In February 2018, the National Labor Relations Board ruled that Google’s termination of the engineer did not violate federal labor law and that [Google had discharged the employee only for inappropriate but unprotected conduct or speech][845] that demeaned women and had no relationship to any terms of employment. 
> 
> Yet other employees are resistant to change in whatever form it takes. As inclusion initiatives and considerations of diversity become more prominent in employment practices, wise leaders should be prepared to fully explain the advantages to the company of greater diversity in the workforce as well as making the appropriate accommodations to support it. 
> 
> Accommodations can take various forms. For example, if you hire more women, should you change the way you run meetings so everyone has a chance to be heard? Have you recognized that women returning to work after childrearing may bring improved skills such as time management or the ability to work well under pressure? If you are hiring more people of different faiths, should you set aside a prayer room? Should you give out tickets to football games as incentives? Or build team spirit with trips to a local bar? Your managers may need to accept that these initiatives may not suit everyone. Adherents of some faiths may abstain from alcohol, and some people prefer cultural events to sports. Many might welcome a menu of perquisites (“perks”) from which to choose, and these will not necessarily be the ones that were valued in the past. Mentoring new and diverse peers can help erase bias and overcome preconceptions about others. However, all levels of a company must be engaged in achieving diversity, and all must work together to overcome resistance.

## 10. Wrap it up with a bow

![Course lesson graphic 10][image-84]

I once had the opportunity to interview one of Harvard's most well revered educators: Dan Levy. He shared about an approach he uses in his teaching called airport ideas. These are the most important concepts that if he saw a student in an airport five years after taking his class, they would still want to talk with him about. In this lesson, we consider the airport ideas from business ethics (BUSN 435) and what other business ethics thinkers have to say are among the most important ideas that university students should be taking away from a class such as this one. We will explore BUSN airport ideas, the nature of business ethics, and and nature of the ethical business leader. 

#### 10.01 | BUSN 435 airport ideas

This idea of breaking a class down to the most essential elements is challenging, given that you are each so different and are likely to benefit from a variety of the learning we have done together in this class. However, this is my best attempt at framing the sorts of things we might talk about years after you completed this course. Following each statement is the learning outcome from the class that it is most closely associated with. 

1. **Reflective practice is a key component to greater self awareness, which is vital in continually becoming a more ethical person.** If I saw you in an airport in five or more years, it would be edifying to know that you regularly reflect on, write about, and talk about your own integrity and ethical choices you're making in a business context. One thing I hope this class has done for you is given you the opportunity to reflect on the most essential questions, ones that have been asked for thousands and thousands of years. Part of any effective self-awareness effort involves reflection and an openness to change our minds about even those things with which we believe most deeply. And to consider some of the ways we can heighten our ability to live out God's presence and love in this world.  Even in and especially in a work context (considering the amount of time most of us spend working in our lives and the impact, positive or negative, that we can have in and through our work).

   Sometimes during college it can seem that with the assignments piling up, they are meaningless. I've certainly experienced that before in my various educational endeavors. My hope is that this class has given you at least some capacity and competence at being able to reflect on how you feel about different ethical issues and why you have those believes, and a resilience to be curious about the business world in a deeper way than before.

   *Learning outcome: Reflect on, articulate, and change your minds about some aspects of what it means to be ethical*

2. **Knowing about philosophers and the ways in which they frame how we might make ethical decisions is essential in continually becoming a more ethical person.** As I mentioned, people have been asking ethical questions for time immemorial. My hope is that you will remember some of these thinkers' names, such as Aristotle, Jeremy Bentham, John Rawls, and others, considering the ways in which they have continued to influence our thinking today of what it requires to be an ethical person. My hope is that you are now able to examine how different ethical frameworks might attempt to address various business dilemmas, too. To see utilitarianism being used to make business decisions, or deontology, or on the other end of things, egoism, is an important way to reflect on the choices that we make in our workplaces and businesses that we own.

   *Describe ethical frameworks and thinkers; Explore those frameworks and thinkers in the context of business*

3. **Recognizing that most choices in business are not dichotomous and avoiding dualistic thinking is an ongoing practice to help us become more ethical people. Regular expansions of our individual and collective imagination helps us become more ethical employees, business owners, investors, and consumers.** One indicator of someone not having studied or thought much about ethics is the idea that any of this is easy. My hope would be that as you think about being an employee, you would have a sense of what it means to be ethical in that context. You wouldn't allow yourself to let cognitive dissonance be remedied by you deciding that you don't owe your employer your own integrity.

   Those of you who become business owners wouldn't overly simplify your role as providing jobs to individuals and within the community, but would see a broader sense of the ways in which business owners can act with integrity and benefit positively people's lives beyond an income. As an investor, my hope would be that you would consider where you invest your money and whether those investments align with your values. And as consumers, my hope is that we all think about the power of our purchasing dollars and the peril of us making mindless purchases, not thinking about the idea of having fewer possessions being a key to a lighter weight in this world, and also thinking about the power of us purchasing from companies that are more ethical.

   *Identify ways to be a more ethical employee, business owner, investor, and consumer*

4. **It's an ethical imperative that we each take the steps to verify information before we share it with others online and offline. Part of being ethical in business is remaining informed about what is happening in the context in which we work, with the help of credible sources.** Not a day goes by when I am consuming news via podcasts, social media, or through various news entities  that I don't think about the SIFT model by Mike Caulfield. It seems that there are constantly new ways that we might be duped by people attempting to influence our votes or attempting to harm democracy or simply attempting to get us to buy into a lie. I'm thankful that I have a practice in SIFT that is so easy to employ and so fast. And the fact that it is able to adapt as the continued threats to finding out what is true in this world proliferate.

   My hope for you is that you believe there are journalists out there today that are doing incredible investigative work and in whom we can place our trust in getting information about the parts of the world we cannot ourselves observe. My hope is also that you recognize not all of the media is such, employs such individuals and that you have confidence that you can and should continue to refine your skills in SIFT and your own capacity for assessing what is credible in your online world.

   *Use an established framework (SIFT, by Mike Caulfield) to determine the accuracy of news pieces about business ethics*

5.  **Learning has only happened if and when it shapes our lives in some way. Seeking to become a more ethical person means putting what we learn about ethics into practice in some tangible ways.** One of the hard parts about college is that it's nearly impossible to know what you'll actually wind up using in your life, besides the idea of, quote, using, close quote, your knowledge is a fairly utilitarian way of thinking about an education. I get it, though, as I can recall wondering why I was required to take certain classes in college or do certain things. Looking back now, there are things I wish I had learned more about, and there are things that I could have done without. The more decades that pass, the more glad I am for a well-rounded education that addressed both skills I would need, but also just a collection of information and knowledge that would combine together to make me into an educated person.

   Some of that involves practical things, a lot of it doesn't. And it's so very hard to know, well, you're going through it, let alone a few years later.

   I make ethical decisions every day in my job as dean and professor.  I also have a podcast that brings up ethical questions related to my work and my beliefs about teaching and learning. My hope is you will be able to put this learning from the class into practice in tangible ways. Some of that may come soon for you, though my suspicion is neither of us will know for a long while to come the ways in which certain aspects of this class may have shaped your thinking such that it translates into action in seemingly small and big ways in your life and career.

   *Put the collective learning from this course into practice in a tangible way*

#### 10.02 | The nature of business ethics

> Business ethics should be grounded in *deontology* more than in *utilitarianism*. That is, the ends should not typically be considered sufficient justification for the means when it comes to framing a business strategy. Rather, it is the means that ennoble the ends. Utilitarianism, as a consequentialist theory and when applied to business, emphasizes the greatest good (or profit) for the greatest number of shareholders. However, this may be inappropriate criterion for determining what is truly ethical in the conduct of business because business morality should not to be centered only on calculations of profit or loss. Deontology, on the other hand, focuses on the motives and reasons why entrepreneurs engage in business and the methods that they implement in doing so. Ultimately, both theories have a place in business practice, but a preference should be shown to deontology.
> 
> The honor or shame that accrues to business as a profession is directly attributable to the ethical practices of its leaders. So, if business as a whole has an unsavory reputation, it is a likely consequence of the practices in which management engages. And while this reputation is not easily changed, it can be improved through a diligent commitment by management to do so.
> 
> To pit *ethics* against *profits* and insist that a business leader must choose between the two is a false dichotomy. In truth, successful business can be practiced in ethical fashion. Further, ethical conduct by a business will naturally draw the loyalty of many consumers and clients. Not only that, but employees and other stakeholders of that business will also approve, and their relationship to the company might become even closer as a result.
> 
> Similarly, it diminishes ethics to insist that it is useful only for keeping business leaders out of jail and avoiding opprobrium, such as through social media. Ethical behavior *can* keep executives safe from indictment, but it also accomplishes much more. Ethical business practices honor the profession and endow it with integrity and credibility.
> 
> When it comes to hiring for and promoting within the workplace, merit and commitment should be assigned the highest value. At the same time, *merit* should not to be seen as a code word for discrimination; nor should it be disparaged. Business ethics applies to all people equitably in the sense that race, ethnicity, creed, sex, sexual orientation, age, and disability all are irrelevant to the abilities that they bring to the workplace.

**? 10.02 | Review questions | The nature of business ethics**

Consider the statements below based on the content provided about business ethics, deontology, utilitarianism, and ethical practices in business. Indicate whether each statement aligns more closely with Deontology or Utilitarianism, or if it represents a general ethical practice that is not specific to either theory.

- [[Deontology] (Utilitarianism) [General Ethical Practice]]
- [ [X]() [ ]() ] Business ethics should focus on the motives and reasons behind business actions rather than solely on outcomes.
- [ [ ] [X] [ ]() ] The primary criterion for business ethics is achieving the greatest good for the greatest number of shareholders.
- [ [ ]() [X] ] Ethical business practices can enhance a company's reputation and integrity.
- [ [X]() [ ]() ] The means by which business goals are achieved are more important than the ends themselves.
- [ [ ]() [X] ] Ethical conduct in business attracts loyalty from consumers and strengthens relationships with stakeholders.
- [ [ ]() [X] ] Merit and commitment are crucial for hiring and promotions, emphasizing fairness and equity over discrimination.
- [ [ ] [X] [ ]() ] Ethics in business is only relevant for avoiding legal troubles and public criticism.
- [ [ ]() [X] ] Insisting on a choice between ethics and profits presents a false dichotomy; businesses can operate successfully and ethically.



#### 10.03 | The nature of the ethical business leader

> An ethical business leader appreciates the existence of multiple stakeholders and accepts responsibility for all of them. These include employees, shareholders, customers/clients, vendors, suppliers, wholesalers, retailers, and the community as a whole within which a corporation resides. While not all stakeholders are *equal* in significance, they nonetheless *all are significant*.
> 
> Ethical entrepreneurs are good stewards of the social and physical environments where they do business. They safeguard the earth at the same time that they protect human capital.
> 
> In addition, the ethical executive engages in both private and corporate philanthropy. Thus, he or she is willing to commit a portion of the funds of his or her organization, as well as that of his or her personal wealth, to worthy charitable community organizations.
> 
> Corporate professionals earn respect through the manner in which they lead and conduct business. There is no positive correlation between the trappings of their success—the homes they own, the cars they drive, the clothes they wear—and their character as human beings. The limousines and jets that they commandeer and the vacation resorts that they frequent are externalities completely unconnected with what Martin Luther King, Jr., called “the content of their character.” If anything, excessive material possessions blind business leaders to their most important managerial tasks.
> 
> In truth, leaders who are in business only for the salary and attending perquisites have found the wrong profession, for they will constantly endure frustration in bearing the responsibilities that come with the privileges.
> 
> And while successful executives are compensated more than their subordinates, it should not to be many multiples more. The less disparity that exists between the highest- and least-paid members of a company, the greater the level of teamwork and commitment that will prevail among all. In short, people will work harder and make a deeper commitment to a company that has a leadership team with which they can identify.
> 
> Additionally, an MBA is not a license for arrogance on the part of its holder. Ethical leaders are justifiably proud of their business acumen, but to lord it over others risks sacrificing their effectiveness as managers. Sometimes the least educated member of a firm may know the most about sustaining the dignity and self-worth of everyone on the team and, therefore, may be the most essential employee for the company to have for that purpose.
> 
> An accomplished executive is not insulated from his or her employees and should not [use command and control approaches to get what they want from] subordinates, but rather [treat them like] a partner or colleague or coworker, and so, a concerned boss.
> 
> In this same way, ethical leaders are welcomed and admired instead of feared and resented. Respect from colleagues, employees, and competitors ultimately cannot be compelled. Instead, it flows naturally from the just and fair ways in which leaders manage and compete.
> 
> Worthy managers sustain the dignity and self-respect of all who surround them. This at once acknowledges the basic humanity of those with whom they work and simultaneously inspires them to contribute their best effort.
> 
> Similarly, the best business leaders take pride in the accomplishments of the business and its employees. This success may never be accorded directly to managers themselves, but employees assuredly recognize those bosses who help them accomplish their best. Further, it is precisely this kind of leader for whom most employees will be motivated to go above and beyond merely what is required of them on the job.
> 
> In short, ethical business executives become the enablers of professional success among their colleagues. This is [about] placing the interests of the firm and one’s coworkers above those of oneself. When this occurs, the enterprise succeeds in a way in which all associated with it may take pride. This is actually the essence of the best business leadership.
> 
> A goal of a more egalitarian workplace—one in which managers and employees respect one another—is a renewed sense of loyalty among all who are there. Too often today we witness distrust along the management/labor divide. Each side accuses the other of harboring no commitment except to itself. Unfortunately, the accusation frequently is true. One way to dispel it is for business leaders to take the first steps in restoring the broken sense of obligation that owners and employees owe each other. This may be the most important task of business leadership now and going forward.

#### 10.04 | More than anything else

As we wrap up this course with a bow, it's essential to reflect on the intersection of a Christian faith and our professional lives. The exploration of ethical frameworks, the acknowledgment of privilege, and the commitment to equity and inclusion all serve as foundational elements that have guided our discussions and learning. But beyond these academic considerations lies a more profound, personal call to action—a call to live out our faith with unwavering integrity in the business world. The damaging effects of cognitive dissonance, especially when our actions in the workplace diverge from our deeply held beliefs, are profound. This discord between belief and behavior not only impacts our mental and emotional well-being but also our spiritual health. 

My hope for each of you is that this course has not only equipped you with the knowledge and tools to navigate the ethical complexities of the business world but also inspired you to reflect deeply on your own faith tradition. May you see every decision, interaction, and challenge as an opportunity to demonstrate the love, justice, and mercy at the heart of God's word. Let your work be a testament to your faith, a means through which you can extend God’s love to colleagues, clients, and the broader community.

That living with integrity is not a destination. Rather, it is a continual process of growth and discernment. It involves making choices that align with your beliefs, even when it's difficult, and seeking reconciliation when you fall short. The integration of faith and work is an ongoing endeavor, one that demands humility, courage, and a commitment to lifelong learning. 

> May you act justly, love mercy, and walk humbly with your God (Micah 6:8). 

In your work, may you be a person of integrity, a witness to the transformative power of living out one’s Christian faith.






[^1]:	As I think back to my college classes, the ones that I still draw from today, all these decades later, are the ones in which I was challenged in some way outside the normal class time. One professor who is particularly memorable at having done so was [Bernard McGrane][1]. In his sociology classes, we would be asked to break a social norm in some way, like entering an elevator in a busy business complex and not immediately turn around and look at the direction that the door would open, when we reached our floor. Pretty much all my assignments were me writing about how I just couldn't allow myself to break out of the norm in the ways his assignments described. I rarely get into an elevator to this day (decades later) without thinking of him.

[^2]:	My inspiration for the synchronicity involved in having ten lessons and ten challenges comes from the incredible Mike Wesch. His [Anth101][2] cultural anthropology course site continues to stretch and expand my imagination, each time I visit it.

[^3]:	You probably figured this out, already, but I created that LEGO box image using artificial intelligence. Perhaps some of may have also noticed that none of the students depicted in the picture appear as if they are women. The first time I asked the bot to create an image of a female professor with blonde hair and glasses, the minifig of the professor was of a man (with a scruffy mustache and beard) with long, blonde hair.  We will be talking a lot about this in class, but bias exists all around us, and within us. And the more we can 'name' when it happens, the more we can seek to create a more just and equitable world. In the meantime, enjoy the LEGO box (with more to come throughout our class). For more about ethics in AI, see Leon Furze's [9 posts about Teaching AI Ethics][3]. 

[^4]:	I'm realizing now that the class was (maybe still is?) called stage combat. But sword fighting seems so much better that I'm going to leave the error in and just go with it. If you need some help with accepting mistakes, you've got to listen to David Wilcox signing [Leave It Like It Is][6]. I love listening to it and being reminded not to take myself and my human foibles so seriously. 

[^5]:	There's a lot more nuance regarding social media's impact on youth. The [Pew Research Center has some key findings from 2023][24] to explore for more. 

[^6]:	Those from historically marginalized populations may experience what is known as weathering, which refers to a phenomenon where individuals from marginalized racial and ethnic groups experience the cumulative effects of stress, discrimination, and microaggressions over time. This term was coined by Dr. Arline T. Geronimus in the early 1990s.

[^9]:	Choices seem like such a good thing, in theory. However, as Mike Caulfield says in the in-depth section of this part of his SIFT course, "Many choices seems promising until you actually have to choose: UB research explains motivation fact..." He then links to [an article in Science Daily][257], which explains how: "People faced with more options than they can effectively consider want to make a good decision, but feel they're unable to do so, according to the results of a novel study. Despite the apparent opportunities presented by a lot of options, the need to choose creates a 'paralyzing paradox,' according to the authors. 'You want to make a good choice, but feel like you can't.'"
