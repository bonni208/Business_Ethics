I am so glad you're here. While I have taught this class well over ten times, this time feels different. In the Spring of 2024, I have decided to 'burn the class down to the ground' and rebuild it in a format inspired by some of the greatest teachers I have ever met. Also, each class is unique and I am so looking forward to us becoming an us in the coming weeks. 

> Watch the following video to get to know a few things about me, as well as discover a bit about our class.

# Start

This course is designed to be engaging, challenging, and practical, encouraging you to think deeply about your roles in shaping the ethical landscape of business. My hope is that you will 'show up' for it in the fullness of who you are and that together we will cultivate the kind of environment that is necessary for that kind of vulnerability to be possible. The is made up of ten lessons [^1] and ten challenges[^2]. Each lesson is designed to generate curiosity and help reinforce the relevance of the content. Each challenge provides opportunities to apply the learning in your unique context and to take time out for personal reflection. 

> "There is no such thing as the right place, the right job, the right calling or ministry. I can be happy or unhappy in all situations. I am sure of it, because I have been … deciding to do this, that, or the other for the next five, ten, or twenty years is no great decision. Turning fully, unconditionally, and without fear to God is. Yet this awareness sets me free."

[^1]: My inspiration for the synchronicity involved in having ten lessons and ten challenges comes from the incredible Mike Wesch. His [Anth101](https://anth101.com) cultural anthropology course site continues to stretch and expand my imagination, each time I visit it.
[^2]: As I think back to my college classes, the ones that I still draw from today, all these decades later, are the ones in which I was challenged in some way outside the normal class time. One professor who is particularly memorable at having done so was [Bernard McGrane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_McGrane). In his sociology classes, we would be asked to break a social norm in some way, like entering an elevator in a busy business complex and not immediately turn around and look at the direction that the door would open, when we reached our floor. Pretty much all my assignments were me writing about how I just couldn't allow myself to break out of the norm in the ways his assignments described. I rarely get into an elevator to this day (decades later) without thinking of him. 


## 00. Why take a business ethics class

![Course header graphic](https://innovatelearning.s3.amazonaws.com/busn435-course-header-lesson-00.jpg) 

This is text below the graphic. Maybe it has to be there? 

--{{0}}--

Taking a business ethics class is crucial for people looking to better understand the ways in which decision making and our beliefs get challenged, tested, and refined in the workplace, as a consumer, or as a business owner. Especially for those who claim a Christian worldview, a class like this can help prepare future leaders to navigate the complex ethical challenges that arise in the business world. With innovations such as artificial intelligence and facial recognition technology, the number of ethical dilemmas in business is increasing. As new technologies emerge, their long-term impacts, both positive and negative, may not be apparent until they have been in use for some time, as seen with the effects of social media on children and teenagers[^1]. 

--{{1}}--

As Christians, we are called to love our neighbors, tell the truth, and seek to live our God’s love in the world. While you will see references to biblical principles such as the golden rule in this class, it is not intended to be a theology class. Instead, you will be invited to reflect on your values, which often will intersect with ones embedded throughout Christianity, broadly speaking. Recognizing that most of us will go on to work in professional contexts that require us to work with people who are different than us and who follow other faith traditions or belief systems, you're going to be asked to express your perspectives in such a way as to be understood by people who have diverse worldviews. 

> I sent an email out to those who were registered for the class a few weeks back, asking for you to reply to let me know why you're taking a class about business ethics. If you haven't done so, already, please email me and share your reasoning and what you hope to get out of the course. 

### 00.01 It's more important than sword fighting

 --{{0}}--

When I first started working at Vanguard, I had my first teaching assistant (TA). His name was Brandon and he was about to graduate. To finish up his coursework, he needed units, but they could be in anything he wanted to take. I thought it was so cool that he got to take sword fighting[^1], even though he wasn't a theatre major and never set foot on the stage. They would practice on the Heath lawn and sometimes I would catch glimpses of them out there, looking like they were having a blast. 

 --{{1}}--

This may be controversial, but for most people (besides theatre majors), I'm going to go out on a limb and say that business ethics is more important than sword fighting. If you find this offensive, reach out to me. Let's talk. I'm open to being wrong on this one. Speaking of sword fighting, I don't think I can reference it without putting [a clip from of one of my favorite movies of all time: The Princess Bride](https://youtu.be/I73sP93-0xA?si=dRfer2WimjEO2f53). 

!?[The Princess Bride movie clip - My Name is Inigo Montoya (1987)](https://youtu.be/I73sP93-0xA?si=dRfer2WimjEO2f53)

 --{{2}}--

I'm pretty sure that Brandon never got as good as those actors in The Princess Bride at stage combat while at Vanguard, but he sure did brighten my days and I'm glad to have known him. I should probably get back to why someone may want to take a class about business ethics. 

[^1]: I'm realizing now that the class was (maybe still is?) called stage combat. But sword fighting seems so much better that I'm going to leave the error in and just go with it. If you need some help with accepting mistakes, you've got to listen to David Wilcox signing [Leave It Like It Is](https://youtu.be/S7mkdHQX-NE?si=xpb8WTS0ZSUKR7NL). I love listening to it and being reminded not to take myself and my human foibles so seriously. 

### 00.02 You will have a guide for life

 --{{0}}--

I realize that sounds pretty dramatic. But I truly believe that the more we understand about ethics, in general, and the context that most of us will spend a huge percentage of our lives (work), the more we will be able to bring more of God's love into the world. This next part is going to get super technical, sine a definition seems in order right about now: Business ethics are the principles that guide decision-making and are vital for transparency, inviting feedback, considering the impacts on employees, stakeholders, and society, and reflecting on past experiences. 

 --{{1}}--

Most of us like to consider ourselves ethical people. However, without being aware of the contexts in which we may be faced with incredibly challenging decisions, ones for which there are not easy answers, we are likely to make a choice that may not align with our espoused values. Every year we seem to hear about a company involved in some sort of ethical scandal affecting workers, customers, society as a whole, or the environment. Watch [The Importance of Business Ethics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHrDUu4Rjtg) to explore this further. 

> The speaker in [The Importance of Business Ethics](https://youtu.be/pHrDUu4Rjtg?si=Wra8DhuTZi21FcfV) discusses the importance of ethical behavior in business and the consequences of unethical actions. The video presents scenarios illustrating ethical dilemmas, cites examples of unethical corporate behavior, and emphasizes the negative impacts of a lack of ethics in organizations. Discover the significance of adhering to protected values and how ethical behavior can lead to improved employee morale, productivity, and long-term profitability, while recognizing how unethical actions can harm a company's reputation and investor confidence.

> Here are some questions to test your understanding from watching the video. 

Volkswagen is mentioned for lying about emissions in the video.

[[X]] True
[[ ]] False

According to the video, a company's relationship with investors has no impact on ethical standards.

[[ ]] True
[[X]] False

The video suggests that employees with strong commitment to ethical values are more likely to report unethical behavior.

[[X]] True
[[ ]] False

What does the video primarily discuss?

[[ ]] Benefits of coffee consumption
[[X]] Ethical dilemmas in business
[[ ]] The history of Starbucks
[[ ]] Employee loyalty

According to the video, what is the quickest way to lose trust with employees?

[[ ]] Demanding high ethical standards
[[X]] Lying to employees
[[ ]] Offering fair trade products
[[ ]]  Conducting experiments

What did the individuals in Wagner's experiment receive $5 for?

[[ ]] Reporting ethical breaches
[[X]] Flipping tails four times
[[ ]]  Lying to their employers
[[ ]] Treating customers unethically

Ethical responsibilities extend to society by promoting sustainable practices and corporate social responsibility (CSR), which are increasingly expected by customers, employees, and investors. To customers, ethical responsibilities include avoiding misleading practices like greenwashing and false advertising. Ethical treatment of employees is also crucial, as fair practices contribute to a successful organizational culture, which can benefit the company economically and legally.

[^1]: There's a lot more nuance regarding social media's impact on youth. The [Pew Research Center has some key findings from 2023](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/04/24/teens-and-social-media-key-findings-from-pew-research-center-surveys/) to explore for more. 

### 00.02 Your professor finds utter joy in teaching | About me

Since the age of five, I knew what I was going to do for a living. I would have my stuffed animals and dolls set carfully out in my room, approximating a classroom. My mom had bought me materials from a local educational store. I had the books that my 'students' could use, as well as the 'teachers' edition, used to guide me in my pedagogy. My bedroom door had a sign hung on it, which read: Room 208. The name I used was Miss. Monroe, a testiment to the power of the 1970s version of the tv show Charlie's Angels' characters in my life at the time. 

When I was in college, picking a major was easy. I majored in social sciences, meaning I got to pick three of my favorite subjects to focus on: psychology, sociology, and history. I was certain that I would graduate with a single subject waiver to teach high school classes and would earn my teaching credential during what would have been my fifth year in college. I did graduate on time with a bachelors degree in social sciences, but my adventures in teaching have taken me plenty of places, but never inside a high school classroom. 

> I have always wanted to teach. 

Fast forward to today. I teach as a professor of business and management at Vanguard. I'm also dean of teaching and learning, which gives  me opportunities to collaborate with other faculty to improve all of our teaching and support efforts that allow students to thrive in their learning. My passion is in continually becoming more effective facilitating learning for students. I’m also fortunate to get to coach faculty in my dean role. 

![Bonni podcasting](https://innovatelearning.s3.amazonaws.com/bonni-podcasting.jpg)

Since June of 2014, I have been airing weekly podcast episodes of [Teaching in Higher Ed](https://teachinginhighered.com). I started podcasting upon the urging of my husband, Dave, who I had met while earning my MA degree in Organizational Leadership. He had started the [Coaching for Leaders](https://coachingforleaders.com) podcast three years prior to his nudging for me to launch one. Given how much I enjoy talking about teaching and learning, I'm grateful for the ways in which those hundreds of conversations have shaped me all these years. 

I've been married to Dave since April of 2005. It took us many years and lots of medical interventions, but our two kids came into the world and have been surprising and delighting us ever since. One of my favorite things about being a parent is how infectious our son's and daughter's collective curiosity can be. 

If you would like to learn more about me, I have a fairly active presence online, including: 

- [Teaching in Higher Ed](https://teachinginhighered.com/) - website with my weekly podcast episodes, rare blog posts, and speaking resources from when I'm invited to share at other universities or conferences about teaching and learning
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bonnistachowiak/) - professional connections and occasional reflection posts
- [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/bonni208) - personal connections and occasional pics of what I'm up to

### 00.03 If you show up for the work, you may just find your life transformed

![Dr. B holds a sign that reads: 'show up for the work'](https://innovatelearning.s3.amazonaws.com/BonniHeadshots2022-46.jpg)

Those social media profiles that include a cover image as part of what we are invited to set up, I often post a picture of me, sitting in my Vanguard office, holding a sign that reads: 

> Show up for the work. 

This is inspiration taken from the life of Christian author Rachel Held Evans, who sadly passed away in her late 30s. Her legacy lives on, in terms of inviting us to think seriously about what we believe and be open to changing our minds. She had a sign hanging above her writing desk that said those same words, representative of her vulnerability in spending time and being in relationship with people who thought differently than she did about important issues in the world. 

You are also likely to notice that I enjoy laughing and having fun. As Christopher P. Long says:

> Joy is at the heart of all meaningful work.

My hope is that we'll take our character seriously and the call to love our neighbors, while not taking ourselves too seriously (leaving room for growth and humility). May I be a person who models that right along with each of you. May you take the radical step of deciding each week that you're going to show up for the work in this class. If we do that together, it's quite possible we could leave changed people. 

## 00 How this class works

Speaking of showing up for the work, that's something that's important for you to do in this class. Yet, the act of showing up might look quite different, depending on your unique context and preferences. This isn't an easy class (at least that's what I've been told), but it is one that provides radical flexibility, in terms of how and when you can show up. 

### 00.01 The space-time continuum: Synchronous and asynchronous attendance

Ok. Not really. I'm not actually going to be teaching anything about the space-time continuum in this course. If you're interested in that topic, you're going to want to take a different class. Or, [watch a video with Neil deGrasse Tyson explaining it a gazillion times better than I'll ever do](https://youtu.be/SJhovNXqH6A?si=cvVoZmYg39ja3BR7). 

However, I do want to share how this class works, in terms of the 'time' that class is held each week. In a normal class, you walk into a classroom and the professor 'marks' you as present. Sometimes there are points associated with you entering the room (and staying there). Sometimes, you have more autonomy for determining when it makes sense for you to attend. 

In our class, we have Zoom sessions, which are somewhat like a normal class, in that they have a start time and an end time. However, there's also an option for you to not participate in those, but to otherwise demonstrate your having 'shown up' for class that week. 

### 00.02 Your story matters

Vanguard has used the Your Story Matters tagline for quite some time. Some people find it to be trite, but I've always really liked it. I suppose how you feel about it may depend on how sincere you believe someone to be when they say that to you. 

> Your story matters to me. 

I started teaching at Vanguard in 2004. You can imagine that I've met a lot of students in that time. To this day, I always get excited and nervous about a new class starting. As weird as this may sound, you matter to me, even though in some cases, we may not have ever met, yet. I am looking forward to getting to know you throughout this class. 

### 00.03 Our stories matter

Individual stories are compelling. Something powerful happens when groups form and create collective stories together. In this class, I'm looking forward to when we become an 'us.' 

### 00.04 It takes a village, or at least some reliable tools

My first job out of college was working for a computer training company. I used to teach technology classes to business professionals and would often fall asleep with a thick book next to me, back when people used to read books to learn how to use a software application. Even today, I love technology enough to mark on my calendar when any Apple Keynotes will be held, such as at their annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). Dave, my husband, and I used to consider it a 'romantic' date before we were married to sit and watch the latest keynote from WWDC back in the day. 

In this class, there is an essential set of tools that you'll need to use, in order to be successful. 

| TOOL                   | DESCRIPTION                                                  | DIFFICULTY |
| ---------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :--------: |
| **Google docs/slides** | Throughout our class, you will be provided with a link to a document, which gets copied as a template inside of your Google account. Despite there being advances in what Microsoft 365 offers us, there's still nothing as fast and easy, as accessing a Google document and engaging with it on your own, or with others. |    Easy    |
| **Quizlet**            | One of the best study methods supported by research is known as retrieval practice, or the testing effect. And one of the best tools I know of to create and share digital flashcards to support that practice is Quizlet. From your computer or phone, you can login to Quizlet, join our class, and strengthen your learning via the shared flashcards. |    Easy    |
| **Instagram**          | Did you know that Instagram allows you to create a separate account from your main one? In this class, we will each keep an account where we can share the learning from our class, engage with each other and build community. |   Medium   |
| **Raindrop.io**        | A big part of our class is going to be sharing with each other what we are learning and how we see business ethics through our unique contexts and current events. We will therefore need a place to store our stuff that connects us with each other and back into Canvas. We are going to use a digital bookmark tool called Raindrop.io, which lets us save stuff in a shared bookmark list, but will also push what we're finding onto our Canvas course shell. |   Medium   |
| **Canvas Studio**      | Inside Canvas is a video creation and collection tool called Canvas Studio. When you're logged into Canvas from a computer, you can access the tool way over on the right hand side of your browser, in the same place you can view the calendar, dashboard, etc. This semester, we will be creating and sharing many videos and having everything in one place is going to be incredibly helpful for us all. |    Hard    |
|                        |                                                              |            |



### 00.05 Ten lessons and challenges

You will notice a pattern in this class. Throughout the semester, we will all: 

- Learn stuff - by watching videos, reading text, talking to each other and people we connect with as a class, wrestling with case studies, checking our understanding through games and quizzes
- Do stuff - challenge ourselves to go beyond just learning something, but actually applying it in some way
- Share stuff - the best kind of learning is the kind that is done in community with others

I know it is cliché, but you will get out of this class what you put into it. While I recognize that each of you has busy schedules and plenty of other priorities, I expect that you will invest not just time into this course, but also that you'll challenge yourself to make this a good ROI (return on investment) for the time and money spent such that you can be a part of it. Do the right thing by investing in yourself and others this semester.

### 02.01 | What's the right thing to do? The moral side of murder | 50 minutes | #watch #seek

Watch: Sandel first video

In the first lecture of his course on moral reasoning, Michael Sandel presents a hypothetical scenario to his students: Would you kill one person to save the lives of five others? Is it the right thing to do? This scenario launches a discussion on moral reasoning and the complexity of making ethical decisions in extreme situations.

Test your understanding of the basics of the concepts Sandel brought up in this first lecture in his Justice series. It's better if you don't look up the answers on the internet, as this is supposed to challenge your brain (not your searching skills). If you get any question wrong, you can try, again, so do yourself (and your memory) a favor and allow the retrieval practice a chance to work.

Discuss Justice - Part 1

The following discussion questions are adapted from Michael Sandel's materials. Answer the three questions posed below, as a means of reflecting further on the first Justice video. Refrain from looking up answers on the internet, as I want to discover what you think is the right thing to do here, not be influenced by what others think, or have thought in the past... 

Each question should prompt answers from you that are at least 4-5 sentences. You may alternatively record a video for each of the questions (please do the answers on separate videos, should you choose this route). Paste the link to each video in your reply. 

------

Let’s start with utilitarianism. According to the principle of utility, we should always do whatever will produce the greatest amount of happiness and whatever is necessary to prevent the greatest amount of unhappiness. But is that right? Should you always try to maximize happiness? Should you always do whatever is necessary to minimize unhappiness?

------

1. There are times when the only way to prevent harm to a large number of people is to harm a smaller number of people. Is it always permissible to harm a smaller number in order to prevent harm to a large number? 
2. Suppose you are driving through a narrow tunnel and a worker falls onto the road in front of you. There is not enough time for you to stop. If you keep straight, you will hit the worker and kill him, but if you swerve left into oncoming traffic, you will collide with a school bus and kill at least five children. What’s the right thing to do? Does utilitarianism have the right answer? 
3. Ten thousand innocent civilians live next to a munitions factory in a country at war. If you bomb the factory, all of them will die. If you don’t bomb the factory, it will be used to produce bombs that will be dropped on fifty thousand innocent civilians in another country. What’s the right thing to do?

Ethical frameworks

Case study: Research context 



 --{{0}}--

Discuss how it went for you going through the ethical decision making part 1. Are you at all familiar with the ethical concerns involved in medical research, or was more of this new to you? Did you notice any of the items you had to sort evoking strong reactions from you? What ones seemed super easy to categorize and why do you think that was? As you sorted them, what items made you think about how they show up in other contexts outside a medical research one? How have you seen some of these questions raised in this exercise show up in aspects of your life?

## 04. Let's not get duped (or pass our ignorance onto others)

![Course lesson graphic 04](https://innovatelearning.s3.amazonaws.com/busn435-course-header-lesson-04.jpg)

It's not fun to look foolish. Yet it's easy to be tricked, given the state of where most of us get our information today: online.

I don't mean to sound offensive in saying the part about sounding ignorant. We're all ignorant about lots of stuff. You should try talking to me sometime about sports, for example, if you want to find someone ignorant on that broad set of subjects. 

The goal is to become more educated about the stuff that is important to us and to know when we don't know enough about something to be a credible source (or know how to spot a credible source). 

### 04.01 | Meet a Mikey or maybe two? | 15 minutes | #sense

Consider the following (and notice if you can hear a voice associated with these words):

> He likes it. Hey, Mikey. 

If you say these words to someone around my age, they'll likely know exactly what you're talking about. However, since most of you (ok. All of you) are likely younger than me, here's what Mikey was famous for, back when I was a kid.

!?[Commercial for Life Cereal](https://youtu.be/CLQ0LZSnJFE?si=0r5RYZbAG_rtYFPD)

What ever happened to the guy who played Mikey in that commercial? They're sometimes known as urban legends. There was one about Mikey, back in the day. People would talk about how you never see him anymore. Where did Mikey go? Well, it turned out (or so people said) that he had died in the most tragic of ways. 

**It must have been the pop rocks.** 

People said it was some bad combination of pop rocks and Diet Coke. Or maybe just plain Coke? I may be getting my urban legends and actual science experiments (like the one with Mentos and Diet Coke, which really does work) confused. 

How would we have figured out if this was true back at that time? There wasn't an internet to go check. There were newspapers, limited by page and word counts and professional journalists and researcher assistants.

### 04.02 Serve up the starter course, sir | #sense

Mike Caulfield has developed a great course to get us up and running with SIFT. I'm going to be making use of a lot what he has shared in his [Check, Please! Starter Course](https://checkpleasecc.notion.site/checkpleasecc/Check-Please-Starter-Course-ae34d043575e42828dc2964437ea4eed), which he has made available under a Creative Commons license[^1]. As long as I attribute what I share to Mike's work and point people back to his Check, Please! Starter Course, we're good (ethically and legally speaking).

### Lesson One: Introduction to SIFT

> This course will take you through the basics of quick source and claim-checking, and introduce you to our "four moves", a series of actions to take when encountering claims and sources on the web. 
>
> These course materials can be used for self-study, as part of a formal course, or as a set of independent assignments to practice your skills.
>
> The course is broken up into lessons, each of which can be completed in a single sitting. They take from 20 to 45 minutes, are composed of 5 to 15 pages, and include instruction and a series of exercises. While some exercises may seem repetitive, we recommend you complete them all, as the point is not just learning what fact-checking is, but building a fact-checking *habit*.
>
> The first lesson is a bit longer than the rest, and will introduce you to our basic approach — the "four moves" and the acronym we use to remember them: SIFT. The lesson will take 40 minutes to complete, including all readings, activities, and videos.

###### Vocabulary: claims, sources

- For the purpose of this course, a **claim** is a statement that purports to express something about reality. "The U.S. landed a space craft on the moon in 1969" is a relatively simple claim that is true. "The moon landing of 1969 was fake." is a simple claim that is false. "The mission to land on the moon was driven by Cold War fear more than scientific curiousity" is a complex claim one can have a range of opinions on, but is still, for a given context, either a well-supported claim, a controversial claim, or a claim lacking any real support.
- A **source** is the place where a claim or other information can be found. This course is a source of information about disinformation. Most claims can be found in multiple sources. You might find information about the moon landing in the Wall Street Journal, a website like Gizmodo, a textbook, a research paper, or a video recording of astronauts talking about the mission.

#### **Play Fakeout!** 

> Let's start this module with an activity designed by some folks at Civix Canada. Fakeout is an interactive lesson that tests your ability to detect "fake news" (we actually don't like that term, but more on that later).

![fakeout screenshot](https://checkpleasecc.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F248f9047-9d8d-41b8-b85f-b920f4b4aab6%2Ffakeout.png?table=block&id=f3cca8dd-265a-41a3-b41f-fb717f8c8c5b&spaceId=092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc&width=1370&userId=&cache=v2)

####  The problem with checklist approaches

> We've been doing research into why students fail to separate fact from fiction on the web.
>
> What we've found? Students are bad at the web because they've been taught techniques that make them bad at it. And they've learned those those bad techniques from *teachers*.
>
> Here's some things students often believe:
>
> - They believe that .org's are more trustworthy than .com's.
> - They believe that a good looking layout and few typos mean something is trustworthy.
> - They think pages that have ads on them are less trustworthy than those that don't.
> - They think that footnotes automatically make a site credible.
>
> These are only a few of the (very wrong) things students believe. Before you learn to read the web you may have to unlearn some of the stuff you've been taught.

#### How CRAAP goes astray

![A picture of the CRAAP method with 20+ questions.](https://checkpleasecc.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F0270152f-f0c3-421d-9e54-ae005ffa0f59%2Fcraap.jpg?table=block&id=70c03c84-53e4-48c9-8259-d7094c6876eb&spaceId=092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc&width=1400&userId=&cache=v2)

> Most instruction students get about reading the web is derived from a set of approaches called "checklist approaches".
>
> Sometimes these approaches were presented as literal checklists. Above is a checklist for a methodology called CRAAP. (I'm not joking).
>
> Sometimes they weren't checklists, but a set of "things to look for in a web page."
>
> What the approaches had in common was this: you'd come to a webpage and look for signals that the page was trustworthy on the *page itself*. You'd ask questions like
>
> - Does this look professional?
> - Are there spelling errors?
> - Is there scientific language?
> - Does it use footnotes?
> - The "checklist" idea? Students were told the more "good" things the page had the more "trustworthy" it was.
>
> Except there are three problems with this approach. Big problems.

##### Problem 1: The signals are meaningless

![Picture of Word document with autocorrect](https://checkpleasecc.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F6c2a4e96-7d12-4448-aeac-5297d6998faf%2Fspellcheck.jpg?table=block&id=36429352-6ca8-48b6-bf09-2f0e48305af8&spaceId=092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc&width=710&userId=&cache=v2))



> Most things people are told to look for? They're easy to fake. It's really cheap to get a good-looking site nowadays. You can be a disinformation agent from China or Russia and still use spell check. Anyone can add footnotes to make something look more serious (students do it all the time!) The same holds for using scientific language.
>
> And a lot of things students are told to look for have no basis in reality at all. In our research we have found students believe
>
> - .orgs are better than .coms (No.)
> - non-profits are better than for-profits (Wrong.)
> - less ads on a page means the page is more reliable (Not even close.)
>
> To put it simply — the things that might mean something are easy to fake, and many things students are taught to look for don't mean anything at all.

##### Problem 2: The checklist processes take too long

>Checklist processes were developed for students trying to decide which of a number of library resources to use for a paper. Given that time frame, such an approach might make sense. You can spend 20 minutes looking at each of three journal articles you found to see which would be the best fit for an end of term research project.
>
>In 2019, however, our problem is not deciding between three half-decent library resources over the course of an afternoon. Instead we are forced to sift through hundreds of possible search results and social media posts to try and determine whether each is worth our attention or belief.
>
>Take this TikTok video, for example. In it, one user has made a video that complains about the discontinuation of plastic straws out of what she sees as too high a level of concern about turtles. It's a bit meanly expressed, but that's her point. Another user posts a reaction — by 2050 there will be more plastic in the ocean than fish.

<iframe width="560px" height="800px" allowfullscreen="true" allow="autoplay *" title="duet with at beastmoder247 it is about more than just turtles savetheoceans" src="https://vanguard.instructuremedia.com/embed/a59c0eb3-77da-4741-90db-8b274b102b2b" frameborder="0"></iframe>

>It has literally taken me longer to explain this video than it takes you to watch it. But is the claim true? And what would happen if you had to engage in 20 minutes of investigation for every 10 second piece of content you viewed that made a claim?
>
>Actually, we know what happens when students are given in-depth techniques to deal with the flood of content that reaches them — they don't use them. Without quick methods people decide to share content like this based on whether it seems believable, or worse, they just decide they can't trust anything at all.
>
>The same is true with search. People use search to inform themselves about a variety of professional and civic issues. They search because they need to get information on a specific topic of pressing importance: how to safely change a tire, whether they should see a doctor about a rash, if the mayor's decision regarding panhandling will have a good or bad impact on the homelessness problem.
>
>But the biggest gap is not whether they research deeply. It's whether they check at all. Take that factoid about plastic and 2050. If you could reliably check it in 60 seconds, you might. If not, you're either going to reject it or accept it without checking — mostly unconsciously. Without quick methods to search and sift, your "knowledge" about an issue will slowly become a mental shoebox of unverified scraps you heard here and there around the web.
>
>While short methods may seem less rigorous, they are in fact better than long methods for many tasks. When I switch lanes while driving on the highway, I don't do a ten minute analysis of whether a car *might* be in the lane next to me. I check the mirror, do a head check, and change lanes. If my father had given me a ten minute lane-changing process when teaching me to drive, I wouldn't use it, and frequent accidents would just be a part of my life. This is the sort of thing you need for reading the web as well.

##### Problem 3: Using too many criteria results in stupid decisions

>One popular idea is that checklists are important because they force students to evaluate dozens of criteria instead of just a few. But does evaluating more criteria result in better decisions? Many teachers say yes. The research says no.
>
>The problem with having dozens of criteria is that many of them conflict. Readers then get overwhelmed, unsure to which ones they should pay the most attention.[^2] And that produces what I call the "sleazy car salesperson" effect.
>
>Maybe you've had the good fortune to never have to deal with a car dealership. But the way it usually goes is this. You go in to get a car and you just want automatic braking, a rear camera, and satellite radio. What happens? Well, they've got a car that has all three, but it's also the luxury sedan and it's $8,000 more. You do get seat warmers and remote start, which are worth x hundred dollars, and the new side collision detection that's at least $1,000 as an after-market addition. Or you can get this other car that has two features but not the third, and if you add on the aftermarket cost it's less expensive than the luxury car, but you don't get that side collision detection, etc., etc. And... well, it's exhausting even to read that, right?
>
>Car dealers set up cars this way intentionally, so that you can never weigh a couple factors in isolation, which leads to us being cognitively overwhelmed and making bad decisions. The effects of this sort of criteria overload are well-documented, going back decades. Yet methodologies like CRAAP set up processes in the same way.
>
>On a pre-assessment we give to students, for example, we have students evaluate a statistical claim about firearm background checks. The sort of response we see repeatedly is, "Well, it's a .org so it's likely to be trustworthy, but it has an ad on the page so maybe not." It's this is "car lot" cognition. There's a tidal wave of conflicting signals so in the end we throw up our hands and say, "Who can know?"

[^2]: Choices seem like such a good thing, in theory. However, as Mike Caulfield says in the in-depth section of this part of his SIFT course, "Many choices seems promising until you actually have to choose: UB research explains motivation fact..." He then links to [an article in Science Daily](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/06/190613153712.htm), which explains how: "People faced with more options than they can effectively consider want to make a good decision, but feel they're unable to do so, according to the results of a novel study. Despite the apparent opportunities presented by a lot of options, the need to choose creates a 'paralyzing paradox,' according to the authors. 'You want to make a good choice, but feel like you can't.'"

#### Thank you, sir, may I have another

We're back to Mike Caulfield's Check, Please! Starter Course and he's about to get to the main dish: SIFT. All these eating metaphors are making me hungry. 

##### Introducing SIFT

> So if long lists of things to think about only make things worse, how do we get better at sorting truth from fiction from everything in-between?
>
> Our solution is to give students and others a short list of things to do when looking at a source, and hook each of those things to one or two highly effective web techniques. We call the "things to do" moves and there are four of them:

![Infographic showing the steps of SIFT: Stop, investigate the source, find trusted coverage, trace claims, quotes and media to the original context.](https://checkpleasecc.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Fe3662e32-fba3-4ede-a0a1-3158cac5438b%2Fsift.png?table=block&id=a7a1f341-c590-4253-8f75-48453f8be726&spaceId=092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc&width=1400&userId=&cache=v2)

</article>

<article>

###### Stop

>The first move is the simplest. **STOP** reminds you of two things.
>
>First, when you first hit a page and start to read it — STOP. Ask yourself whether you know and trust the website or source of the information. If you don't, use the other moves to get a sense of what you're looking at. Don't read it or share it until you know what it is.
>
>Second, after you begin the process and use the moves it can be too easy to go down a rabbit hole, chasing after more and more obscure facts or getting lost in a "click cycle". If you feel yourself getting overwhelmed in your fact-checking efforts, STOP and take a second to remind yourself what your goal is. Adjust your strategy if it isn't working. Make sure you approach the problem at the right amount of depth for your purpose.

</article>

<article>

###### Investigate the source

> We'll go more into this move in the next lesson. The key idea is to know what you're reading *before* you read it.
>
> This doesn't mean you have to do a Pulitzer prize-winning investigation into a source before you engage with it. But if you're reading a piece on economics by a Nobel prize-winning economist, you should know that before you read it. Conversely, if you're watching a video on the many benefits of milk consumption that was put out by the dairy industry, you probably want to know that as well.
>
> This doesn't mean the Nobel economist will always be right and that the dairy industry can't ever be trusted. But knowing the expertise and agenda of the source is crucial to your interpretation of what they say. Taking sixty seconds to figure out where it is from *before* reading will help you decide if it is worth your time, and if it is, help you to better understand its significance and trustworthiness.

</article>

<article>

###### Find trusted coverage 

> Sometimes you don't care about the particular article that reaches you. You care about the claim the article is making. You want to know if it is true or false. You want to know if it represents a consensus viewpoint, or if it is the subject of much disagreement.
>
> In this case your best strategy is to ignore the source that reached you and look for other trusted reporting or analysis on the claim. In other words, if you receive an article that says koalas have just been declared extinct from the Save the Koalas Foundation, the winning strategy may be to open up a new tab and find the *best* source you can that covers this, or, just as importantly, scan multiple sources to see what the consensus seems to be. In these cases we encourage you to "find trusted coverage" that better suits your needs — more trusted, more in-depth, or maybe just more varied. We'll show you some techniques to do this sort of thing quickly.
>
> Do you have to agree with the consensus? Absolutely not! But understanding the context and history of a claim will help you better evaluate it.

</article>

<article>

###### Trace claims, quotes, and media back to the original context

> A lot of things you find on the internet have been stripped of context. Maybe there's a video of a fight between two people. But what happened before that? Who started it? What was clipped out of the video and what stayed in? Maybe there's a picture that seems real but the caption is dubious at best. Maybe a claim is made about a new medical treatment supposedly based on a research paper — but you're not certain if the paper supports it.
>
> In these cases we'll have you trace the claim, quote, or media back to the source, so you can see it in its original context and get a sense if the version you saw was accurately presented.

</article>

<article>

###### It's about REcontextualizing

> There's a theme that runs through all of these moves: it's about getting the necessary context to read, view, or listen effectively. And doing that *first*.
>
> One piece of context is who the speaker or publisher is. What's their expertise? What's their agenda? What's their record of fairness or accuracy? So we investigate the source. Just as when you hear a rumor you want to know who the source of it is before reacting to it, when you encounter something on the web you need the same sort of context.
>
> When it comes to claims, a key piece of context includes whether they are broadly accepted or rejected or something in-between. By scanning for other coverage you can see the expert consensus on a claim, learn the history around it, and ultimately land on a better source.
>
> Finally, when evidence is presented with a certain frame — whether a quote or a video or a scientific finding — sometimes it helps to reconstruct the original context in which the photo was taken or research claim made. It can look quite different in context!
>
> In some cases these techniques will show you claims are outright wrong, or that sources are legitimately "bad actors" who are trying to deceive you. But even when material is not intentionally deceptive, the moves do something just as important: they reestablish the context that the web so often strips away, allowing for more fruitful engagement with all digital information.

#### It's time to get those feelings out (in journal form)

You are being introduced to some skills that will be new for most of you. It may start to seem like a lot, so it is time to start capturing the learning in such a way as to be more memorable for you in the coming weeks and months. I've kept notes on SIFT and have even vlogged about my learning in a public way on my YouTube channel. 

##### Your Notebook

> Throughout this course you'll be asked both to do basic fact-checking activities and to think more deeply about the material presented. Here we introduce three things to help you with that.
>
> We ask that you keep a notebook of your fact-checking exercises in a text editor or a word processor like Notepad, Google Docs, or Microsoft Word. If you are taking this as part of a class, you will periodically be asked to submit the contents of your fact-checking notebook for feedback from [your professor and others in the class]. 
>
> The format of the notebook is simple. For each fact-checking assignment you will be given a heading. Write the heading in your document in all capital letters. Then hit enter and answer the questions you are asked to answer. Avoid any fancy formatting as you may have to post this in a format where the formatting will not carry over. 

Here's an example of what your notebook might look like:

![TOXIC FOOD BOWLS | The source here is reputable, an independent organization that hires real journalist, and has won awards](https://checkpleasecc.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Fb3d35e6e-fe12-4566-82c8-56df5dbf0714%2Fnotebook.png?table=block&id=1e665ada-81d5-4603-b007-c43956c1bfef&spaceId=092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc&width=1320&userId=&cache=v2)

At the very end of the course, you'll be asked to pick your favorite example from the notebook and to create a video, which will be shared with others in the class. Keeping links in your notebook will help save you time, later on, when you go to share your learning in a more public way.  

#####  Reflection prompts and vocabulary

Reflection prompts are used to suggest questions for deeper exploration. Each time you see questions for reflection in the course, copy and paste them over to your notebook and prepare to discuss them either during a synchronous class, or asynchronously, through a video or written response. 

###### Questions for reflection

- Do you think media literacy could help some people avoid processes of radicalization? Or are the social drivers too strong?

- Are all conspiracy theories bad? Are all wrong? What do you think makes a conspiracy theory harmful? Do you hold beliefs that others would dismiss as conspiracy theory?
- Do you know anyone that has gone down the conspiracy rabbit hole on an issue? What have you learned from that experience about what drives conspiracy thinking?

</article>

Starter Course](https://checkpleasecc.notion.site/checkpleasecc/Check-Please-Starter-Course-ae34d043575e42828dc2964437ea4eed) include the following note, so people know how to get back to the original: *The text and media of this site, where possible, is released into the CC BY, and free for reuse and revision.

The Miseducation of Dylan Roof

>Throughout this course, we'll be using a mixture of both weighty and trivial examples. Sometimes it may seem there's not much downside to being misinformed: who really cares if the "Alexa Voice-Activated Toilet" is real or Monster Brand Caffeinated Ham is fake?
>
>But there are serious social implications to people not paying attention to where their information is coming from.
>
>The video below primarily makes a point about Google. But given the facts presented here, is there a way that a lack of web literacy also played a role?

!?[Video: The miseducation of Dylann Roof](https://youtu.be/qB6A45tA6mE?si=Ids7nDj22uJwIMt1) 

> One of the patterns we see in online radicalization — from Nazism to ISIS — is that people often begin their journey by discovering information on the web from extremists that shocks them. Usually they are unaware — initially — of the source of the information, and if they were aware of the source they might be more skeptical of the information presented. By the time they understand who is supplying the information and what their motives are, they are already aligned with those organizations' viewpoints.
>
> Once a person starts down the conspiracy spiral, it's very hard to get back out. There is such a gap between what they see in "respected" sources and what they see from extremist sites that they come to believe the respected sites must be in on the conspiracy. And while in the past many people might hold one or two conspiracy theories, the hyper-connected, algorithmic nature of the internet creates a situation where believing in one conspiracy theory may lead to your exposure to more and more radical conspiracy theories.

###### Questions for reflection

- Do you think media literacy could help some people avoid processes of radicalization? Or are the social drivers too strong?
- Are all conspiracy theories bad? Are all wrong? What do you think makes a conspiracy theory harmful? Do you hold beliefs that others would dismiss as conspiracy theory?
- Do you know anyone that has gone down the conspiracy rabbit hole on an issue? What have you learned from that experience about what drives conspiracy thinking?

</article>

#### Conclusion of Lesson One

> In this 30 minute lesson you learned why some traditional approaches to online media literacy don't work, and were introduced to a new approach, encapsulated by the acronym SIFT. This approach favors "moves" rather than analysis, and encourages you to make quick checks before you read material.

> Now that we have the basics down we will start practicing some of the web techniques that you can use to get quick answers as you "sift".

<article>

### Lesson Two: Investigate the Source

> One of the four "moves" is to "investigate the source". The following two short videos (less than four minutes) will introduce you to this move. As you'll see, we're not expecting people to do ground-breaking research, just to do some very quick checks.
>
> The first (3:15) video shows how many of the things we think will make us better at the web — raw intelligence, critical thinking skill, familiarity with technology — don't necessarily help:

!?[Online Verification Skills - Video 1: Introductory Video](https://youtu.be/yBU2sDlUbp8?si=cRd-fUMk4OAo-94e)

> The second video (2:45) introduces you to our second move: investigate the source. (In case you forgot the first move already, the first move is "Stop")

#### Just add Wikipedia

> On the previous page you watched a video demonstrating the "Just add Wikipedia" technique. In that case we opened a new tab and fired up a search result page, typing a domain plus "Wikipedia" into the search box. In this next video, we show a variation of that technique that you can do in the omnibar of your browser (that part of the browser in which you can type a web location or a search phrase). We also show how this is particularly helpful for quick research on organizations.

!?[Just add Wikipedia (Source Verification Omnibar Hack)](https://youtu.be/oBqEci8eXXA?si=sToxcnuhc3lH8sN2)

> Notice that while the most relevant Wikipedia article usually floats to the top of results, this is not always true. In the case of researching Nuclear Matters, the most informative Wikipedia page was the second result. When looking at *Before It's News* the first Wikipedia result that came up was the right one — but it was second in the Google results, after a result from Rational Wiki.

#### Use Surprise as an Indicator

> What do you look for on the Wikipedia page? It varies. Sometimes — as with the Nuclear Matters material in the video above — what sticks out most is the agenda of the group, e.g. something you thought was a research group turns out to be a political advocacy group with ties to the industry. Sometimes it's the fact that a source has a history of unreliability, as was the case with *Before It's News*. And many times (most, actually!) it will turn out the source just fine, as we saw above with the *SacBee* example.
>
> But rather than a checklist of things to look for on the Wikipedia page, I want you to focus on two organizing questions:
>
> - Is the site or organization I am researching what I thought it was?
> - If not, does it make it more or less trustworthy?
>
> If you thought something was from a straight news site and it turns out to be from a conspiracy site, that should surprise you. And given your new knowledge, your initial impression of the trustworthiness should plummet. If you thought you were looking at a minor, unknown newspaper and it turns out to be a multi-award winning national newspaper of record, maybe your assessment of its trustworthiness increases. The effects on trust are of course contextual as well: a small local paper may be a great source for local news, but a lousy source for health advice or international politics.

###### Vocabulary: paper of record

A national paper of record is a reputable paper that attempts to cover all important national news with staff reporters. They are distinguished from regional and local papers which use staff primarily for local or regional news.

#### What's Important Depends On Context

> What you take note of when doing investigate the source searches will be highly dependent on how you initially interpreted the source.
>
> As an example, I remember looking at a comment on Twitter from what I thought was an internet rando. He was talking about a historical point with a lot of confidence. I thought it was an interesting point, but not worthy of my attention. Out of habit I did a Wikipedia check on his name and found that he was a world renowned historian who had written the most popular textbook on the subject at hand. Surprise! I went back and read his comment more carefully and thought about it more deeply.
>
> Conversely, I've occasionally seen newspapers on the web that seem to me (in the names and the way they look) like old established papers. Throwing their name into a *just add Wikipedia* search I find they don't have a Wikipedia page (odd if the paper is supposed to be a major paper) or that they were established less than two years ago. Neither of those outcomes means the paper is not to be trusted, but it might change the way I read it or prompt me to do more research.
>
> Note that there can't be any hard and fast rule here — there's not a list of rules that says writing a textbook on the subject is good, not having a Wikipedia page is bad. But a lot of this is obvious in the specific case.
>
> One caveat — some students, used to just reacting to claims, may not be forming conscious opinions of what a source is. If this is the case with you, take just the smallest fraction of a second to think about what you think you are looking at before you research it. Do you think this is a major news source? A local paper? A government database? A grassroots, people-powered movement? A professional organization? As we go through the course we'll talk more about some of these categories of sources.

Vocabulary: grassroots, professional organization

- **Grassroots organizations** are organizations which are primarily run and funded by interested citizens and independent activists.
- **Professional organizations** provide an array of services and support to people in a given field. An organization for electrical engineer may provide professional standards to follow, research on best practices, training for members, and lobbying for the field.

#### SIFTing: Alexa-enabled toilet? (prompt)

> Each of our "Sifting" exercises will give you a scenario, show you a prompt associated with it, and ask you a question associated with it. You should "use your moves" on the prompt (the components of SIFT), then write your results in your notebook. If you are a student in a class, when you write your results in your notebook, make sure to use the specified heading, so that your teacher knows what prompt you are responding to.
>
> We start the course with some pretty light exercises. So here's your first exercise. A friend sends you a text about a new "Alexa Toilet":

![SMS message with text "Great, now there's an Alexa microphone in the bathroom too"](https://checkpleasecc.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Fdb279215-906a-498a-93fd-66c73d6687f7%2Ftoilet1.png?table=block&id=c5108c12-f468-4dc4-92d6-4557aed780ee&spaceId=092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc&width=690&userId=&cache=v2)

Visit the [story on Tom's Guide about the Kohler Alexa toilet](https://www.tomsguide.com/us/kohler-numi-alexa-toilet,news-28957.html) and perform the activity described below: 

> Now we could use our "Find Trusted Coverage" move here. But let's hold off on that. The question I want you to investigate is:
>
> - Is Tom's Guide a known product review site or something else?
>
> Use the **Investigate the Source** move, find out what you can. In your notebook, write the heading ALEXA TOILET, hit enter and tell us what you found out.
>
> When you are done, go to the next part to see how a fact-checker might approach this problem.

</article>

<article>

#### SIFTing: Alexa toilet (discussion)

> Here's an example of what a fact-checker might say:
>
> **ALEXA TOILET**
>
> According to Wikipedia, Tom's Guide is a publication run by the people who run Tom's Hardware, a very old and well known product review site. You can find this in the Wikipedia article on Tom's Hardware in the Related Publications section, and if you want to be super sure, click the linked footnote that talks more about the site and confirms this is the right URL for it. It seems like a trusted source for this kind of news.
>
> How did we find that out? We used the Just add Wikipedia trick:

![GIF showing someone typing http://tomsguide.com wikipedia into their web browser and viewing some info about Tom's Hardware](https://file.notion.so/f/f/092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc/2223113f-0fa8-408f-a663-64083a1f9524/toms-guide1.gif?id=2f5f9113-2049-44b4-9d7e-16876465d7f5&table=block&spaceId=092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc&expirationTimestamp=1704427200000&signature=D9s0HdWATVlflwgOAGti86EnPnxr87CBmqe3B374F_U)

> We searched for the site (adding our bare keyword "wikipedia"), and found the most relevant Wikipedia page at the top of the results. It wasn't an exact match, but it was close enough to check it out.
>
> Clicking through to the Wikipedia article Tom's Hardware, we searched (using either control or command-f) for the phrase Tom's Guide on the page, and found it in Related Publications.
>
> This is probably enough to state it's a legitimate site for this sort of story, but if we wanted to be extra sure that the Tom's Guide mentioned here is tomsguide.com, there is a footnote on that part of the Wikipedia page, and if we follow it we find this:
>
> **Los Angeles - September 18, 2007 - TG Publishing LLC (www.tgpublishing.net) a Bestofmedia Group company, one of the top-three online media publishing companies for technology in the world, announced today the rebrand of Gear Digest to Tom's Guide (www.tomsguide.com). Tom's Guide is the definitive online resource for unbiased and trusted information on the latest consumer electronics and technology gear.**
>
> That's a press release from the group that runs Tom's Guide, so it might not be a great resource for some things, but for the purpose of confirming the URL is a match it's perfect. Less than sixty seconds of effort and we know this is a real site and likely a real story. Share the Alexa toilet story with anybody you desire.
>
> Take a look at the answer in your notes. How did you do in your investigation? If you want to touch up your answer having read this, go ahead. 
>
> Although not shown in the animation, we used "control-f" to search for information on the web page. If you are familiar with control-f (command-f on a Mac) continue on with the lesson. But if not, [watch this video on how to find a word on a web page with control-F](https://youtu.be/D-FkKwRD4iY?si=8aq3kaUsf8D0hj5n) and [check out this article on using control-f on the web](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/08/crazy-90-percent-of-people-dont-know-how-to-use-ctrl-f/243840/) — we'll be using it a lot.

#### Wikipedia

> Wikipedia is broadly misunderstood by faculty and students alike. While Wikipedia must be approached with caution, especially with articles that are covering contentious subjects or evolving events, it is often the best source to get a consensus viewpoint on a subject. Because the Wikipedia community has strict rules about sourcing facts to reliable sources, and because authors must adopt a neutral point of view, its articles are often the best available introduction to a subject on the web.
>
> The focus on sourcing all claims has another beneficial effect. If you can find a claim expressed in a Wikipedia article, you can almost always follow the footnote on the claim to a reliable source. Scholars, reporters, and students can all benefit from using Wikipedia to quickly find authoritative sources for claims.
>
> As an example, consider a situation where you need to source a claim that the Dallas 2016 police shooter was motivated by hatred of police officers. Wikipedia will summarize what is known about his motives and, more importantly, will source each claim, as follows:
>
> **Chief Brown said that Johnson, who was black, was upset about recent police shootings and the Black Lives Matter movement, and "stated he wanted to kill white people, especially white officers."[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_shooting_of_Dallas_police_officers#cite_note-NBC.Shot-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_shooting_of_Dallas_police_officers#cite_note-ShapiroSuspect-5) A friend and former coworker of Johnson's described him as "always [being] distrustful of the police."[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_shooting_of_Dallas_police_officers#cite_note-DallasNews.Know-61) Another former coworker said he seemed "very affected" by recent police shootings of black men.[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_shooting_of_Dallas_police_officers#cite_note-DallasNews.Complex-64) A friend said that Johnson had [anger management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anger_management) problems and would repeatedly watch video of the 1991 beating of [Rodney King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_King) by police officers.[[85]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_shooting_of_Dallas_police_officers#cite_note-85)**
>
> Investigators found no ties between Johnson and international terrorist or domestic extremist groups.[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_shooting_of_Dallas_police_officers#cite_note-nprwhatweknow-66)
>
> Each footnote leads to a source that the community has deemed reliable. The article as a whole contains over 160 footnotes. If you are researching a complex question, starting with the resources and summaries provided by Wikipedia can give you a substantial running start on an issue.

#### Aligator (prompt)

Check out both of these news reports and answer the questions below.

[https://abcnews4.com/news/local/granddaughter-of-90-ye...](https://abcnews4.com/news/local/granddaughter-of-90-year-old-woman-killed-by-alligator-sues-west-ashley-nursing-home)

https://kdvr.com/2016/07/29/90-year-old-woman-killed-by-alligator-at-south-carolina-nursing-home/

###### Questions

- Are these trustworthy news sources for this sort of story?
- Is this story likely true?
- If you had to pick the best source of the two based just on what you found on Wikipedia, which one would you pick, and why?

</article>

<article>

#### Alligator (discussion)

> Here's one possible response:
>
> Both these sources are real news sources according to Wikipedia. The alligator story is real. If I had to pick one of the two I would pick the first TV station (abcnews4) in this case because they are more local to the event (they are in Charleston, the city where it happened) vs. the KDVR story which seems to just be reprinting someone else's story (and is in Denver, not South Carolina!)
>
> How do we get there? We start by doing our "just add wikipedia" trick. Let's show the ABC one first:

![GIF showing the ABC add wikipedia trick](https://file.notion.so/f/f/092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc/3b72c03d-534a-4d73-bae9-ef2f542dad1d/alligator-abc1.gif?id=f5e706fd-d26f-4d7d-ab47-aa0a4d83807a&table=block&spaceId=092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc&expirationTimestamp=1704427200000&signature=h4rWparGuJCKsDZ-KEbzAfIY0inpVvKMw4js3kAnD2w)

> We search the URL or domain and add our bare keyword "wikipedia". Selecting the most relevant search result we find it is about a local TV station in Charleston. Just to be sure the article is for the right site, we scroll down and make sure the URL matches. It does!
>
> What about KDVR?

![GIF of typing https://KDVR.com wikipedia into Google browser search](https://file.notion.so/f/f/092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc/83fdb898-ac56-427f-ba6f-5ad716eb2d01/kdvr.gif?id=3d62d56f-baf0-4dbb-b0cb-8e004ed46a15&table=block&spaceId=092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc&expirationTimestamp=1704427200000&signature=6uUWVOpF8DGrB6UtisBYWYr3Ngap0YZ2BLXKra7ffzw)

#### When are local sources good?

> Here's our first reflection: we often talk about authority being "contextual and constructed." Let's take that "contextual" piece. An organization that might have authority in one area, but won't have the same level of authority in all areas. For example, a fitness instructor might be a great person for advice on a fitness routine, but you wouldn't get medical advice from them. Likewise, you might ask your doctor about an illness or medical condition, but you wouldn't expect them to be an expert in aerobics.
>
> Local and national newspapers employ reporters that have very similar skills, much more similar than fitness instructors and doctors. But even here authority differs depending on the type of story. For your first reflection, think of a sort of story where a local paper would have a high degree of authority. Then think of another sort of story where they might have far less authority.

###### Questions for reflection

- For what sort of other stories might a local source be a particularly good authority?
- For what sort of other stories might a local source not be a good authority?

#### Volcano plain (prompt)

> Take a look at this story and answer the questions.

[Malaysia Airline flight forced into emergency landing](https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/malaysia-airline-flight-forced-into-emergency-landing-after-flying-over-icelandic-volcano/)

###### Questions

- What sort of source is this?
- How do you know?

</article>

<article>

#### Volcano plan (discussion)

> Here's one possible response:
>
> **World News Daily report is a satire site that by its own admission does not publish true stories. It's is also the source or a lot of hateful content. I found this out from Wikipedia — the Wikipedia article cited a large range of sources, from Buzzfeed to the Washington Post.**
>
> How do we get there? We start by doing our "just add wikipedia" trick. Let's show the ABC one first:

![Search the URL and add Wikipedia](https://file.notion.so/f/f/092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc/cf2ec0a4-6114-44e1-9664-56b4ef5ce498/volcano1.gif?id=97f137ee-3a02-40ba-b640-6b41a97061bf&table=block&spaceId=092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc&expirationTimestamp=1704427200000&signature=28vk_1iqJnQSMCaEYJLLwbf7Ffxf1THOoGn1lVFUMuo)

> We search the URL or domain and add our bare keyword `wikipedia`. Selecting the most relevant search result we find it is a known satire site.

#### A note about Buzzfeed

> One thing you'll notice in the Wikipedia article is that Buzzfeed News is cited as source. Students are often confused by this, since they are most used to Buzzfeed being primarily a source of videos such as "I tried to eat five popular candies from Romania and this is what happened."
>
> That Buzzfeed site isn't good news source for very much. It's not "fake", but it's not very serious. Years ago, however, Buzzfeed spun off a reliable, award winning news publication under the name "Buzzfeed News" (domain: www.buzzfeednews.com). And harkening back to our "contextual authority" discussion earlier, it turns out that Buzzfeed News has two of the top experts in the world on the "fake news" phenomenon. So when you see a link to Buzzfeed News on question about the trustworthiness of a site, it's well worth following.

#### The Problem of Fauxtire

> One problem — larger in the past, but still extant — is the problem of "fauxtire". Experts on disinformation use the term fauxtire to describe sites such as World News Daily Report which claimed to be satire sites (like the Onion) but in practice were not linked to because people thought they were funny but because people were fooled into thinking the stories were real.
>
> This presents an interesting problem — if you run a site that is supposedly a humor site, but in practice it is convincing people of awful things, are you responsible for that? What if you intentionally tweak satirical headlines so they are more likely to deceive people (and hence make you more money from ads)?

###### Questions for Reflection

- What are your feelings on fauxtire? Is it an ethical practice?
- Should companies like Facebook and Twitter downrank articles if they are being spread based on the impression they are "real" when they are not? What are the dangers of that?

</article>

<article>

#### Conclusion of Lesson Two

> You finished lesson two! In the past thirty minutes, you've learned about one "move" (investigate the source) and one web technique associated with it ("just add wikipedia").
>
> Next up we'll apply what you learned about investigating the source to a couple specific issues.
