I am so glad you're here. While I have taught this class well over ten times, this time feels different. In the Spring of 2024, I have decided to 'burn the class down to the ground' and rebuild it in a format inspired by some of the greatest teachers I have ever met. Also, each class is unique and I am so looking forward to us becoming an us in the coming weeks. 

> Watch the following video to get to know a few things about me, as well as discover a bit about our class.

# Start

This course is designed to be engaging, challenging, and practical, encouraging you to think deeply about your roles in shaping the ethical landscape of business. My hope is that you will 'show up' for it in the fullness of who you are and that together we will cultivate the kind of environment that is necessary for that kind of vulnerability to be possible. The is made up of ten lessons [^1] and ten challenges[^2]. Each lesson is designed to generate curiosity and help reinforce the relevance of the content. Each challenge provides opportunities to apply the learning in your unique context and to take time out for personal reflection. 

At certain parts of my life, I have felt stuck deciding on what seemed like two, binary choices. Like those old fashioned tv game shows where you had to pick door A or door B. 

![Game show in the style of 1950s with two doors as choices: A or B](https://innovatelearning.s3.amazonaws.com/game-show-choice.png)

Someone I worked with reminded me that there are hardly only just two options we might pick in our lives. The options are boundless. But, also, Henry Nouwen reminds us in the following quote that God is with us, through all the choices we make in our life and we can rest easy in that. 

> There is no such thing as the right place, the right job, the right calling or ministry. I can be happy or unhappy in all situations. I am sure of it, because I have been … deciding to do this, that, or the other for the next five, ten, or twenty years is no great decision. Turning fully, unconditionally, and without fear to God is. Yet this awareness sets me free.
>
> -- Henry J.M. Nouwen 

Thank you for taking the time out of your week to get started with Business Ethics (aka BUSN 435).

*While not an actual LEGO set you can buy (nor am I quite that huge in real life), I'm looking forward to us being able to use our creativity together this semester to create something memorable. Not sold in stores. Not available in real life. Not Vanguard's actual campus. Not absent of bias.[^3] You get the idea...* 

[^1]: My inspiration for the synchronicity involved in having ten lessons and ten challenges comes from the incredible Mike Wesch. His [Anth101](https://anth101.com) cultural anthropology course site continues to stretch and expand my imagination, each time I visit it.
[^2]: As I think back to my college classes, the ones that I still draw from today, all these decades later, are the ones in which I was challenged in some way outside the normal class time. One professor who is particularly memorable at having done so was [Bernard McGrane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_McGrane). In his sociology classes, we would be asked to break a social norm in some way, like entering an elevator in a busy business complex and not immediately turn around and look at the direction that the door would open, when we reached our floor. Pretty much all my assignments were me writing about how I just couldn't allow myself to break out of the norm in the ways his assignments described. I rarely get into an elevator to this day (decades later) without thinking of him. 
[^3]: You probably figured this out, already, but I created that LEGO box image using artificial intelligence. Perhaps some of may have also noticed that none of the students depicted in the picture appear as if they are women. The first time I asked the bot to create an image of a female professor with blonde hair and glasses, the minifig of the professor was of a man (with a scruffy mustache and beard) with long, blonde hair.  We will be talking a lot about this in class, but bias exists all around us, and within us. And the more we can 'name' when it happens, the more we can seek to create a more just and equitable world. In the meantime, enjoy the LEGO box (with more to come throughout our class). 



## 00. Let's get it started 

![course header - lesson one](https://innovatelearning.s3.amazonaws.com/busn435-course-header-lesson-00-1.jpg)

Welcome to Business Ethics (BUSN435) at Vanguard University. Throughout your experience of taking ten lessons and then experiencing ten challenges, you will grapple with essential questions about living a life of character and remaining true to your faith within the context of business. My aim is to equip you with the tools and insights necessary to navigate the complex landscape of ethical decision-making in the business world while upholding the values and principles rooted in your beliefs. Through these experiences, I hope to empower you to become an ethical leader who inspires positive change and positively impacts your professional and personal spheres.

> As you progress through this lesson, be sure to watch the videos, read the text, and answer the review questions are you are presented with them. More information is available on Canvas about what's expected, along with due dates, etc. 

One thing you're going to find about me is that I love music. Almost 100% of the time, there's a soundtrack playing in my head. So, if someone says something like: "Let's get it started," my mind is going instantly to music. Like [this song by The Black Eyed Peas](https://youtu.be/IKqV7DB8Iwg?si=AQ-9V0Y4VTCRM0z5). 

> I know I just told you to be sure to watch all the videos. YOU CAN SKIP THIS ONE, because it is just a song. Unless you are really ready to get it started. 😂🎯🎉

Let's go. 

### 00.01 | Why take a business ethics class | 50 min

Speaking of decisions, there are likely many reasons a person may decide to take a class about business ethics. 

**Requirement.** I often hear people say that they needed it to meet some requirement (whether that be for accounting majors to hit the number of units they need to eventually earn a CPA license someday, or for a business major who needs upper division business elective units). 

**Flexibility.** Sometimes students tell me that the flexibility of the course gave them the option to design their schedule to meet their needs (whether that be because they're an athlete and they can better navigate practice times and games, or because they have work during many of the weeks when most of us will be meeting on Zoom). 

**The professor.** Finally, some people say that they have had me for classes, previously, and that they're excited for another adventure together. I don't take that lightly, as it is truly a joy to get to learn with others and I'm glad you have decided to take another class with me. 

**You're not sure ~ yet.** It's also quite possible you don't know yet why you're taking this class. Perhaps as you put together your schedule, everything didn't fall into place like you had hoped it would. My encouragement to you is to consider this week all of your schedule and determine if there are any changes you want to make, as when I was in college, I didn't think as intentionally as I might have liked to do about all the possibilities. If this is you, I don't want you to think you're alone. 

Taking a business ethics class is crucial for people looking to better understand the ways in which decision making and our beliefs get challenged, tested, and refined in the workplace, as a consumer, or as a business owner. Especially for those who claim a Christian worldview, a class like this can help prepare future leaders to navigate the complex ethical challenges that arise in the business world. 

As Christians, we are called to love our neighbors, tell the truth, and seek to live our God’s love in the world. While you will see references to biblical principles such as the golden rule in this class, it is not intended to be a theology class. Instead, you will be invited to reflect on your values, which often will intersect with ones embedded throughout Christianity, broadly speaking. Recognizing that most of us will go on to work in professional contexts that require us to work with people who are different than us and who follow other faith traditions or belief systems, you're going to be asked to express your perspectives in such a way as to be understood by people who have diverse worldviews. 

> I sent an email out to those who were registered for the class a few weeks back, asking for you to reply to let me know why you're taking a class about business ethics. If you haven't done so, already, please email me and share your reasoning and what you hope to get out of the course. 

#### It's more important than sword fighting

When I first started working at Vanguard, I had my first teaching assistant (TA). His name was Brandon and he was about to graduate. To finish up his coursework, he needed units, but they could be in anything he wanted to take. I thought it was so cool that he got to take sword fighting[^1], even though he wasn't a theatre major and never set foot on the stage. The class would practice on the Heath lawn and sometimes I would catch glimpses of them out there, looking like they were having a blast. 

This may be controversial, but for most people (besides theatre majors), I'm going to go out on a limb and say that business ethics is more important than sword fighting. If you find this offensive, reach out to me. Let's talk. I'm open to being wrong on this one. Speaking of sword fighting, I don't think I can reference it without putting [a clip from of one of my favorite movies of all time: The Princess Bride](https://youtu.be/I73sP93-0xA?si=dRfer2WimjEO2f53). 

!?[The Princess Bride movie clip - My Name is Inigo Montoya (1987)](https://youtu.be/I73sP93-0xA?si=dRfer2WimjEO2f53)

I'm pretty sure that Brandon never got as good as those actors in The Princess Bride at stage combat while at Vanguard, but he sure did brighten my days and I'm glad to have known him. I should probably get back to why someone may want to take a class about business ethics. 

[^1]: I'm realizing now that the class was (maybe still is?) called stage combat. But sword fighting seems so much better that I'm going to leave the error in and just go with it. If you need some help with accepting mistakes, you've got to listen to David Wilcox signing [Leave It Like It Is](https://youtu.be/S7mkdHQX-NE?si=xpb8WTS0ZSUKR7NL). I love listening to it and being reminded not to take myself and my human foibles so seriously. 

#### You will have a guide for life

I realize that part about having a guide for life sounds pretty dramatic. But I truly believe that the more we understand about ethics, in general, and the context that most of us will spend a huge percentage of our lives (work), the more we will be able to bring more of God's love into the world. 

A definition seems in order right about now: 

> Business ethics are the principles that guide decision-making and are vital for transparency, inviting feedback, considering the impacts on employees, stakeholders, and society, and reflecting on past experiences. 

Most of us like to consider ourselves ethical people. However, without being aware of the contexts in which we may be faced with incredibly challenging decisions, ones for which there are not easy answers, we are likely to make a choice that may not align with our espoused values. Every year we seem to hear about a company involved in some sort of ethical scandal affecting workers, customers, society as a whole, or the environment. Watch [The Importance of Business Ethics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHrDUu4Rjtg) to explore this further. 

> The speaker in [The Importance of Business Ethics](https://youtu.be/pHrDUu4Rjtg?si=Wra8DhuTZi21FcfV) discusses the importance of ethical behavior in business and the consequences of unethical actions. The video presents scenarios illustrating ethical dilemmas, cites examples of unethical corporate behavior, and emphasizes the negative impacts of a lack of ethics in organizations. Discover the significance of adhering to protected values and how ethical behavior can lead to improved employee morale, productivity, and long-term profitability, while recognizing how unethical actions can harm a company's reputation and investor confidence.

###### ? 00.01 | Review questions | The Importance of Business Ethics

> Here are some questions to test your understanding from watching the video. 

Volkswagen is mentioned for lying about emissions in the video.

[[X]] True
[[ ]] False

According to the video, a company's relationship with investors has no impact on ethical standards.

[[ ]] True
[[X]] False

The video suggests that employees with strong commitment to ethical values are more likely to report unethical behavior.

[[X]] True
[[ ]] False

What does the video primarily discuss?

[[ ]] Benefits of coffee consumption
[[X]] Ethical dilemmas in business
[[ ]] The history of Starbucks
[[ ]] Employee loyalty

According to the video, what is the quickest way to lose trust with employees?

[[ ]] Demanding high ethical standards
[[X]] Lying to employees
[[ ]] Offering fair trade products
[[ ]]  Conducting experiments

What did the individuals in Wagner's experiment receive $5 for?

[[ ]] Reporting ethical breaches
[[X]] Flipping tails four times
[[ ]]  Lying to their employers
[[ ]] Treating customers unethically

Ethical responsibilities extend to society by promoting sustainable practices and corporate social responsibility (CSR), which are increasingly expected by customers, employees, and investors. To customers, ethical responsibilities include avoiding misleading practices like greenwashing and false advertising. With innovations such as artificial intelligence and facial recognition technology, the number of ethical dilemmas in business is increasing. 

As new technologies emerge, their long-term impacts, both positive and negative, may not be apparent until they have been in use for some time, as seen with the effects of social media on children and teenagers[^1]. Ethical treatment of employees is also crucial, as fair practices contribute to a successful organizational culture, which can benefit the company economically and legally.

[^1]: There's a lot more nuance regarding social media's impact on youth. The [Pew Research Center has some key findings from 2023](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/04/24/teens-and-social-media-key-findings-from-pew-research-center-surveys/) to explore for more. 

#### You're joining someone who finds utter joy in teaching and learning

Since the age of five, I knew what I was going to do for a living. I would have my stuffed animals and dolls set carfully out in my room, approximating a classroom. My mom had bought me materials from a local educational store. I had the books that my 'students' could use, as well as the 'teachers' edition, used to guide me in my pedagogy. My bedroom door had a sign hung on it, which read: Room 208. The name I used was Miss. Monroe, a testiment to the power of the 1970s version of the tv show Charlie's Angels' characters in my life at the time. 

When I was in college, picking a major was easy. I majored in social sciences, meaning I got to pick three of my favorite subjects to focus on: psychology, sociology, and history. I was certain that I would graduate with a single subject waiver to teach high school classes and would earn my teaching credential during what would have been my fifth year in college. I did graduate on time with a bachelors degree in social sciences, but my adventures in teaching have taken me plenty of places, but never inside a high school classroom. 

> I have always wanted to teach. 

Fast forward to today. I teach as a professor of business and management at Vanguard. I'm also dean of teaching and learning, which gives  me opportunities to collaborate with other faculty to improve all of our teaching and support efforts that allow students to thrive in their learning. My passion is in continually becoming more effective facilitating learning for students. I’m also fortunate to get to coach faculty and support them in my dean role. 

![Bonni podcasting](https://innovatelearning.s3.amazonaws.com/bonni-podcasting.jpg)

Since June of 2014, I have been airing weekly podcast episodes of [Teaching in Higher Ed](https://teachinginhighered.com). I started podcasting upon the urging of my husband, Dave, who I had met while earning my MA degree in Organizational Leadership. He had started the [Coaching for Leaders](https://coachingforleaders.com) podcast three years prior to his nudging for me to launch one. Given how much I enjoy talking about teaching and learning, I'm grateful for the ways in which those hundreds of conversations have shaped me all these years. 

I've been married to Dave since April of 2005. It took us many years and lots of medical interventions, but our two kids came into the world and have been surprising and delighting us ever since. One of my favorite things about being a parent is how infectious our son's and daughter's collective curiosity can be. 

If you would like to learn more about me, I have a fairly active presence online, including: 

- [Teaching in Higher Ed](https://teachinginhighered.com/) - website with my weekly podcast episodes, rare blog posts, and speaking resources from when I'm invited to share at other universities or conferences about teaching and learning
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bonnistachowiak/) - professional connections and occasional reflection posts
- [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/bonni208) - personal connections and occasional pics of what I'm up to
- [BUSN435 Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/busn435/) - an opportunity for us to experience #OpenEducation, to the extent we are comfortable to do so ~ this account is for our class, specifically 

![BUSN435 Instagram account, displaying a few sample quotes and the profile for the account](https://innovatelearning.s3.amazonaws.com/2024-01-08_10-32-41.jpg)

#### If you show up for the work, you may just find your life transformed

![Dr. B holds a sign that reads: 'show up for the work'](https://innovatelearning.s3.amazonaws.com/BonniHeadshots2022-46.jpg)

Those social media profiles that include a cover image as part of what we are invited to set up, I often post a picture of me, sitting in my Vanguard office, holding a sign that reads: 

> Show up for the work. 

This is inspiration taken from the life of Christian author Rachel Held Evans, who sadly passed away in her late 30s. Her legacy lives on, in terms of inviting us to think seriously about what we believe and be open to changing our minds. She had a sign hanging above her writing desk that said those same words, representative of her vulnerability in spending time and being in relationship with people who thought differently than she did about important issues in the world. 

You are also likely to notice that I enjoy laughing and having fun. As Christopher P. Long says:

> Joy is at the heart of all meaningful work.

My hope is that we'll take our character seriously and the call to love our neighbors, while not taking ourselves too seriously (leaving room for growth and humility). May I be a person who models that right along with each of you. May you take the radical step of deciding each week that you're going to show up for the work in this class. If we do that together, it's quite possible we could leave changed people. 

![Image of a stop sign with a lizard sitting on top of it](https://innovatelearning.s3.amazonaws.com/jose-aragones-81QkOoPGahY-unsplash.jpg)

Go back to your Google slides now and continue there, until such point as it invites you back over for the next part. 

### 00.02 | How this class works

Speaking of showing up for the work, that's something that's important for you to do in this class. Yet, the act of showing up might look quite different, depending on your unique context and preferences. This isn't an easy class (at least that's what I've been told), but it is one that provides radical flexibility, in terms of how and when you can show up. 

#### The space-time continuum: Synchronous and asynchronous attendance

Ok. Not really. I'm not actually going to be teaching anything about the space-time continuum in this course. If you're interested in that topic, you're going to want to take a different class. Or, [watch a video with Neil deGrasse Tyson explaining it a gazillion times better than I'll ever do](https://youtu.be/SJhovNXqH6A?si=cvVoZmYg39ja3BR7). 

However, I do want to share how this class works, in terms of the 'time' that class is held each week. In a normal class, you walk into a classroom and the professor 'marks' you as present. Sometimes there are points associated with you entering the room (and staying there). Sometimes, you have more autonomy for determining when it makes sense for you to attend. 

In our class, we have Zoom sessions, which are somewhat like a normal class, in that they have a start time and an end time. However, there's also an option for you to not participate in those, but to otherwise demonstrate your having 'shown up' for class that week. 

On Canvas, you will see calendar entries most weeks called #connect, which reflect the times most of us will gather at the set time. During that time, we will often spend the time focused on  a portion of the lesson for that week (or occasionally part of a challenge). 

Higher education policies require that we have something that approximates attendance in a normal class, so if you come to the Zoom session, I'll mark you as "S" which stands for synchronous (meaning you attended using the scheduled time option). If you aren't at the Zoom, but you share your lesson for the week by the deadline, I'll mark you as "A" ~ which stands for asynchronous (meaning you opted to do the asynchronous option that week). I'm getting ahead of myself, though. More on this later on. 

#### Your story and our stories matter

Vanguard has used the Your Story Matters tagline for quite some time. Some people find it to be trite, but I've always really liked it. I suppose how you feel about it may depend on how sincere you believe someone to be when they say that to you. 

> Your story matters to me. 

I started teaching at Vanguard in 2004. You can imagine that I've met a lot of students in that time. To this day, I always get excited and nervous about a new class starting. As weird as this may sound, you matter to me, even though in some cases, we may not have ever met, yet. I am looking forward to getting to know you throughout this class. 

Individual stories are compelling. Something powerful happens when groups form and create collective stories together. In this class, I'm looking forward to when we become an 'us.' 

We are going to need to work together to find ways of exploring topics together, while respecting and honoring each other in the process. It is highly likely that we will have different perspectives, making it that much more important to acknowledge and affirm [the imago dei](https://www.christianity.com/wiki/bible/image-of-god-meaning-imago-dei-in-the-bible.html) in each of us. 

#### It takes a village, or at least some reliable tools

My first job out of college was working for a computer training company. I used to teach technology classes to business professionals and would often fall asleep with a thick book next to me, back when people used to read books to learn how to use a software application. Even today, I love technology enough to mark on my calendar when any Apple Keynotes will be held, such as at their annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). Dave, my husband, and I used to consider it a 'romantic' date before we were married to sit and watch the latest keynote from WWDC back in the day. 😂

I continue to find technology fascinating and marvel at both its positive and negative contributions to society and in business contexts. In this class, there is an essential set of technology tools that you'll need to use, in order to be successful. 



| TOOL                   | DESCRIPTION                                                  | DIFFICULTY |
| ---------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :--------: |
| **Google docs/slides** | Throughout our class, you will be provided with a link to a document, which gets copied as a template inside of your Google account. Despite there being advances in what Microsoft 365 offers us, there's still nothing as fast and easy, as accessing a Google document and engaging with it on your own, or with others. |    Easy    |
| **Quizlet**            | One of the best study methods supported by research is known as retrieval practice, or the testing effect. And one of the best tools I know of to create and share digital flashcards to support that practice is Quizlet. From your computer or phone, you can login to Quizlet, join our class, and strengthen your learning via the shared flashcards. |    Easy    |
| **Instagram**          | Did you know that Instagram allows you to create a separate account from your main one? In this class, we will each keep an account where we can share the learning from our class, engage with each other and build community. |   Medium   |
| **Raindrop.io**        | A big part of our class is going to be sharing with each other what we are learning and how we see business ethics through our unique contexts and current events. We will therefore need a place to store our stuff that connects us with each other and back into Canvas. We are going to use a digital bookmark tool called Raindrop.io, which lets us save stuff in a shared bookmark list, but will also push what we're finding onto our Canvas course shell. |   Medium   |
| **Canvas Studio**      | Inside Canvas is a video creation and collection tool called Canvas Studio. When you're logged into Canvas from a computer, you can access the tool way over on the right hand side of your browser, in the same place you can view the calendar, dashboard, etc. This semester, we will be creating and sharing many videos and having everything in one place is going to be incredibly helpful for us all. |    Hard    |
|                        |                                                              |            |

#### Ten lessons and challenges

You will notice a pattern in this class. Throughout the semester, we will all: 

- Learn stuff - by watching videos, reading text, talking to each other and people we connect with as a class, wrestling with case studies, checking our understanding through games and quizzes **#seek**
- Do stuff - challenge ourselves to go beyond just learning something, but actually applying it in some way **#sense**
- Share stuff - the best kind of learning is the kind that is done in community with others **#share**

I know it is cliché, but you will get out of this class what you put into it. While I recognize that each of you has busy schedules and plenty of other priorities, I expect that you will invest not just time into this course, but also that you'll challenge yourself to make this a good ROI (return on investment) for the time and money spent such that you can be a part of it. Do the right thing by investing in yourself and others this semester. 

> "Brothers and sisters, do not be weary in doing what is right."
>
> -- 2 Thessalonians 3:13

My commitment is the same right back to you. As you challenge yourself, I will be continuing to work to be effective at facilitating learning and helping us all to have fun and be compassionately challenged along the way. 

###### ? 00.02 | Review questions | How this class works

> Here are some review questions on how this class works. Test your understanding by answering them. 



What is the definition of synchronous attendance in this class?

[[ ]] Attending class via the alternative attendance options
[[ ]] An option for those who can't meet or prefer not to meet at the scheduled times
[[X]] Attending class during the scheduled time via Zoom
[[ ]] Informing Dr. B about your absence in advance

How is the class structured?

[[ ]] Around five lessons and five case studies
[[X]] Around ten lessons and ten challenges
[[ ]] Around ten lessons, five challenges, and three exams
[[ ]] Around a varied number of lessons and challenges

You must attend the Zoom sessions each week.

[[ ]] True
[[X]] False

You are expected to let Dr. B know if you are going to miss class.

[[ ]] True
[[X]] False

See Canvas and the syllabus for more information about how the class is structured. I'm here, if you have any questions or are confused about how this all works. I know it is not the norm for most classes and may take some getting used to. I have heard overwhelmingly positive feedback about Flex-VU classes in the past and will commit to doing what I can to ensure that we have a good experience together this semester. 



## 01. It's all personal (or is it?)

![Lesson 01 graphic](https://innovatelearning.s3.amazonaws.com/busn435-course-header-lesson-01.jpg)

I'll admit to often feeling more nervous than normal when teaching this class. The topics we explore together tend to sometimes bump up against aspects of our identity such that it feels far beyond the normal way we might approach learning in some other classes. I want for us to take our commitment to being ethical people quite seriously, while not taking ourselves so seriously that we hinder the potential for growth. 

In terms of the importance of taking this class seriously, the following come to mind as crucial reasons to do so:

1. **Moral Integrity:** The study of ethics helps individuals and societies maintain moral integrity. It guides us in distinguishing right from wrong and encourages us to act in ways that align with our values and principles. This fosters trust, respect, and fairness in our interactions with others.

2. **Accountability:** Ethical principles provide a framework for holding individuals and institutions accountable for their actions. It ensures that those who engage in unethical behavior can be held responsible for their actions, leading to justice and fairness.

4. **Long-Term Success:** Ethical decision-making often leads to long-term success and sustainability. Businesses and organizations that prioritize ethics tend to build stronger reputations, attract loyal customers, and retain talented employees.

5. **Personal Growth:** Embracing ethics can lead to personal growth and development. It encourages self-reflection and self-improvement, helping individuals become more empathetic, compassionate, and considerate of others.

On the other hand, not taking ourselves too seriously is also important for several reasons:

1. **Humility:** Recognizing our own limitations and imperfections fosters humility. It allows us to learn from our mistakes and be open to different perspectives and ideas.

2. **Reduced Stress:** Taking ourselves too seriously can lead to excessive stress and anxiety. It's important to be able to laugh at ourselves and not let small setbacks or failures define our self-worth.

3. **Improved Relationships:** People are often drawn to those who have a sense of humor and can take things lightly. It can enhance our social connections and make us more approachable.

4. **Adaptability:** Being flexible and adaptable is easier when we don't take ourselves too seriously. We can better cope with change and unexpected challenges.

5. **Creativity:** A more relaxed attitude can promote creativity and innovation. When we're not overly focused on perfection, we may be more willing to take risks and explore new ideas.

Taking ethics seriously helps us maintain our moral compass, while not taking ourselves too seriously can lead to personal growth, reduced stress, and improved relationships. Balancing these two aspects is essential for leading a meaningful and fulfilling life. It is also a way we can experience greater growth throughout our time together.

### 01.00 | What does it mean to be ethical?

What does it mean to be ethical, especially in business? It's more than just knowing right from wrong; it's about understanding how our decisions impact others. I will be making many references to the show The Good Place in this class. While not set in a business context, The Good Place still offers us many lessons to draw from in business ethics. I won't ruin the ending for you, but will introduce some characters and plot points along the way. 

> "The Good Place" is a television show that originally aired from 2016 to 2020. It was created by Michael Schur and features a unique blend of comedy, philosophy, and ethics. The show revolves around Eleanor Shellstrop, played by Kristen Bell, who wakes up in the afterlife and is told she has entered "The Good Place" due to her good deeds on Earth. However, Eleanor soon realizes that there has been a mistake, as she was not a virtuous person during her life. She teams up with other residents of The Good Place, including Chidi Anagonye (William Jackson Harper), Tahani Al-Jamil (Jameela Jamil), and Jason Mendoza (Manny Jacinto), to try and become a better person and earn her place in this supposed paradise.

In this first clip, we are going to hear about how points get assigned in the good place. Throughout each person's life, they earn and lose points with each good and bad choice. There is a brief mention of suicide in this clip.

You will continue to see clips show up from The Good Place in this course. It is a thought-provoking show that raises important ethical and philosophical questions. Its relevance to us in a business ethics course lies in its ability to spark discussions, illustrate ethical concepts, and provide valuable insights into moral decision-making, accountability, and personal growth, all of which are crucial aspects of ethical behavior in the business world. Besides, it is really funny and most students I meet appreciate humor being incorporated into classes versus more dry material.

#### It's more than just knowing right from wrong 

In answering the question of what it means to be ethical, it's more than just distinguishing right from wrong. It involves navigating a complex landscape filled with shades of grey and moral ambiguity. It's also about understanding how our decisions impact others. Here are several reasons why business ethics goes beyond a simplistic binary understanding of right and wrong: 

1. **Cultural and Contextual Differences**: What may be considered ethically acceptable in one culture or context may not be viewed the same way in another. Business ethics must take into account cultural relativism and contextual nuances. What's morally right in one situation could be morally questionable in another.

2. **Ethical Dilemmas**: Many business decisions involve ethical dilemmas where there are competing moral principles or values. For example, a company may need to decide between maximizing profits and ensuring the well-being of its employees. These situations require careful consideration of trade-offs and balancing conflicting interests.

3. **Subjectivity**: Ethical judgments often involve subjective elements. People may have differing opinions on what is morally right or wrong based on their personal beliefs, values, and experiences. This subjectivity can make it challenging to arrive at a universally accepted ethical framework.

4. **Legal vs. Ethical**: Something may be legal but still unethical, or it may be ethical but illegal. Legal frameworks provide a minimum standard of behavior, but they do not encompass all ethical considerations. Business ethics extends beyond compliance with laws and regulations.

5. **Ethical Grey Areas**: In some cases, there may be ethical grey areas where it's difficult to determine what the right course of action is. These situations require critical thinking, ethical reasoning, and a consideration of potential consequences.

6. **Conflicting Stakeholder Interests**: Businesses have multiple stakeholders with competing interests, including shareholders, employees, customers, suppliers, and the community. Balancing these interests ethically can be challenging, as decisions may impact some stakeholders positively and others negatively.

7. **Ethical Risk Management**: Business ethics also involves managing ethical risks and potential conflicts of interest. Companies must implement policies and procedures to identify, mitigate, and prevent unethical behavior within their organization.

8. **Evolving Ethical Standards**: Ethical standards can change over time as societal values evolve. What was considered ethically acceptable in the past may be viewed as unethical today. Businesses must stay attuned to these changing ethical norms and adapt their practices accordingly.

9. **Gray Areas in Business Practices**: Some business practices, such as marketing tactics, pricing strategies, and competitive behavior, can operate in ethical grey areas. Decisions about how to engage in these practices ethically can be complex and nuanced.

10. **Moral Dilemmas in Leadership**: Leaders often face moral dilemmas where they must choose between conflicting values, such as honesty and loyalty. Ethical leadership involves making difficult decisions with integrity and transparency.

Let's look at an example in a fictional story, but one that is relatable in a real world context. In the movie Zootopia, Judy Hopps (a rabbit police officer) is trying to solve a missing mammals case. During a press conference, she makes an unintentionally insensitive comment about predators. Nick Wilde, a fox and her unlikely partner, takes offense and confronts her about it.

!?[Zootopia clip: Judy Hopps at a press conference](https://youtu.be/_abhnQkHOPU?si=e_0d7b1qjTYr6CKL)

This scene demonstrates how business ethics can move beyond simply right or wrong. Misunderstandings can so easily arise, even with good intentions. While this story is fictional, these kinds of misunderstandings and opportunities for our biases to negatively impact us our relationships happen all the time in a business context. 

Business ethics is a multidimensional field that requires individuals and organizations to navigate complex ethical terrain. It involves considering diverse perspectives, weighing competing values, and making principled decisions that align with one's values and the expectations of society. Recognizing the presence of grey areas in business ethics underscores the need for critical thinking, ethical reasoning, and continuous reflection on ethical principles in the corporate world.

### 01.01 | Let's get personal
This is probably where I'm about to show my age. But in my day, we had Olivia Newton John (who you may know from Grease, but in this case, we're going to her other lesser known role singing Let's Get Physical). You do not have to watch the following video. In fact, the music video on YouTube made me cringe on more than one occasion, so I'm only even posting the audio here. But when we say/ead: "Let's get personal," I'm hoping at least some of us will be hearing the tune of Let's Get Physical in our minds, and singing along with Olivia Newton-John.

!?[Olivia Newton-John - Physical](https://youtu.be/VM7TpVWvJqM?si=ydhVkyb3LJqyfXsK)

I'm going to be asking you to get personal in this class. Applying what you're learning in the uniqueness that only you can bring. I want us to have fun together, yes, yet take our responsibility to love our neighbors quite seriously. Talking about some of the issues we will explore can bump up against our identities and unique cultural contexts. 

#### Imago Dei at the foundation 

One concept I ask that we keep at the center throughout our time together is Imago Dei. It is central to Christian beliefs and has significant implications for various aspects of life, including bringing our ethics and values into a business context. Imago Dei is Latin for "Image of God." It is a fundamental concept in Christian theology that asserts that every human being is created in the image and likeness of God. This concept is derived from the Bible, specifically from the book of Genesis, where it is stated: 

> "So God created humanity in God's own image; male and female, God created them" (Genesis 1:27).

Here's why Imago Dei is essential to consider when studying business ethics in such contexts:

1. **Inherent Human Dignity:** Imago Dei underscores the inherent worth and dignity of every human being. It reminds Christians that all individuals, regardless of their roles in business or society, possess an intrinsic value that should be respected and upheld. This perspective challenges unethical practices such as exploitation, discrimination, or unjust treatment of employees, customers, or stakeholders.

2. **Ethical Decision-Making:** Recognizing the image of God in every person serves as a moral compass in business ethics. Christian business students and professionals are encouraged to make ethical decisions that reflect God's values, such as honesty, integrity, and compassion. This means considering the welfare of others, being fair in business dealings, and avoiding actions that harm individuals or the community.

3. **Compassion and Empathy:** Imago Dei encourages empathy and compassion in business interactions. Understanding that all individuals are created in God's image promotes a sense of responsibility to care for others, including employees, suppliers, and customers. This perspective fosters a business environment that prioritizes the well-being of all stakeholders.

4. **Social Responsibility:** Christians often emphasize the concept of stewardship, which means responsibly managing resources and relationships. Imago Dei reinforces the idea that Christians have a duty to be socially responsible in their business practices. This includes ethical considerations related to environmental sustainability, philanthropy, and community engagement.

5. **Conflict Resolution:** When ethical conflicts arise in business, considering Imago Dei can guide conflict resolution processes. Viewing others as bearers of God's image encourages Christians to seek peaceful and just resolutions, promoting reconciliation and forgiveness rather than hostility or retaliation.

6. **Ethical Accountability:** The belief in Imago Dei reminds Christians of their ultimate accountability to God for their actions, including their business decisions. This accountability encourages transparency, integrity, and the pursuit of ethical excellence in business practices.

Imago Dei is a foundational concept in Christian theology that has a profound impact on how business ethics is approached as Christians. It highlights the inherent dignity of all people, guides ethical decision-making, promotes compassion and social responsibility, and emphasizes accountability to a higher moral standard. Ultimately, it encourages a holistic and ethical approach to conducting business that aligns with Christian values and principles.

#### It's (often) not personal

I'm also going to be asking you to work to avoid taking things personally in both a business or class context, or at least for us to each agree to give each other the benefit of the doubt. This agreement to not take things personally is essential for maintaining healthy relationships and to have effective communication. 

Studying ethics or other potentially polarizing topics can be challenging, and it is important to not take things personally during such discussions. One valuable source of wisdom on this subject is the book [The Four Agreements by Don Miguel Ruiz](https://search.worldcat.org/en/title/182962640). It is one of the best books I read while earning my MA degree. The Four Agreements provides valuable insights into personal growth and interpersonal relationships. The second agreement in the book is [*Don't Take Anything Personally*](https://www.thefouragreements.com/the-second-agreement-dont-take-anything-personally/), and it offers several key principles that explain why this is important. In that section, Ruiz writes: 

> Nothing others do is because of you. What others say and do is a projection of their own reality, their own dream. When you are immune to the opinions and actions of others, you won't be the victim of needless suffering.
>
> --Don Miguel Ruiz

While Don Miguel Ruiz describes this idea, in terms of our 'dreams,' I've often heard people describe it as the movie of our lives, and we are the central character in that movie. Our subjective experiences, self-awareness, and emotional investment in our own lives naturally lead us to perceive ourselves as the stars of the movie of our own stories. While we interact with a diverse cast of characters and share the world with billions of people, our personal narrative remains at the forefront of our consciousness.

As we reflect on the words from Ruiz, we can have our awareness heightened and realize that people's reactions and responses are often a reflection of their own beliefs, experiences, and perspectives. They are the stars in the movies of their own lives. When studying ethics or engaging in discussions on polarizing topics, people may have strong opinions and emotions tied to their personal experiences. It's important to remember that their reactions are not necessarily a judgment of you, or your ideas and identity, but rather a reflection of their own reality. Another quote from Ruiz stresses this idea even further: 

> "Even when a situation seems so personal, even if others insult you directly, it has nothing to do with you. What they say, what they do, and the opinions they give are according to the agreements they have in their own minds."
>
> --Don Miguel Ruiz

This quote further reinforces the concept that people's actions and words are shaped by their own beliefs and agreements. In the context of studying ethics or engaging in discussions on sensitive topics, individuals may hold differing viewpoints. Disagreements and criticisms are often rooted in personal values and perspectives rather than a direct attack on your character.

When we are developing empathy and cultural humility, it's essential to recognize that we are bound to make mistakes. We come from diverse backgrounds and have different life experiences, which can lead to misunderstandings and misinterpretations. By agreeing not to take things personally, we create a simultaneously safe and brave space for open dialogue and learning. Here's how not taking anything personally relates to empathy and cultural humility, two key elements of being ethical in a business context:

1. **Empathy:** When we practice empathy, we strive to understand and share the feelings of others. However, in the process, we might unintentionally say or do something that offends or hurts someone from a different cultural background or with different beliefs. By not taking their reactions personally, we can acknowledge our mistakes, apologize if necessary, and continue to learn from one another without becoming defensive.

2. **Cultural Humility:** Cultural humility involves recognizing the limitations of our own cultural perspective and being open to learning from others. In our journey to become more culturally humble, we might ask questions or engage in discussions that unintentionally come across as insensitive or ignorant. By not taking such reactions personally, we can accept feedback gracefully, educate ourselves, and grow more effectively in our understanding of different cultures and viewpoints.

[The Four Agreements](https://search.worldcat.org/en/title/182962640) teaches us that not taking things personally is crucial for our emotional well-being and growth, especially when studying ethics or engaging in discussions on polarizing topics. Agreeing to not take anything personally allows us to recognize that others' reactions are often a reflection of their own reality and that by maintaining this perspective, we can develop empathy, cultural humility, and engage in meaningful dialogues for personal and collective growth.

#### Let's hold each other accountable

None of what I am describing here is easy. Having Imago Dei at the foundation of how we treat others and agreeing not to take things personally are two of the most challenging ways to approach engaging with other human beings. Let's embrace personal and interpersonal accountability as a means toward striving to embody these two principles. 

> Accountability is the responsibility and obligation of individuals and organizations to answer for their actions, decisions, and outcomes, especially in relation to ethical conduct.

Establishing and maintaining that type of accountability with each other will be worth it, because of the growth made possible when learning in that kind of community. In this next section, we will explore a few ways we can work to accomplish that together and to create the kind of community that will foster the highest trust and deepest learning opportunities.

### 01.02 | Develop emotional intelligence

Throughout this class we are going to be working on developing and cultivating emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence (EI) refers to the ability to recognize, understand, manage, and effectively use one's own emotions and those of others. It is a crucial skill in both personal and professional contexts, including business. Strengthen your emotional intelligence by understanding and managing your own emotions. Recognize that not everything is a personal attack or criticism. Practice empathy and try to understand the motivations and emotions of others in the situation. This allows you to respond thoughtfully rather than react emotionally.

In this short Inside Out movie clip, the character of Joy realizes the value of sadness. It is vital for us to be able to recognize our emotions and to attempt to understand and empathize with others' feelings. 

!?[Inside out clip: Joy realizes the value of sadness](https://youtu.be/V9OWEEuviHE?si=gPCW1ha4JD_bIkPg)

In order to explore the topics in this class, recognizing the varying perspectives we will inevitably have, emotional intelligence is going to be crucial. The key elements of emotional intelligence are: 

1. **Self-Awareness:** This involves recognizing and understanding one's own emotions, strengths, weaknesses, and values. It helps individuals assess how their emotions impact their actions and decisions.

2. **Self-Regulation:** Self-regulation is the ability to control and manage one's emotions, especially in high-pressure situations. It includes impulse control, adaptability, and emotional resilience.

3. **Motivation:** Motivated individuals set and work toward goals, even in the face of challenges. They often have a strong sense of purpose and can delay gratification.

4. **Empathy:** Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of others. It involves active listening, being attuned to non-verbal cues, and demonstrating compassion.

5. **Social Skills:** Effective interpersonal skills, including communication, conflict resolution, and collaboration, are essential for building positive relationships and achieving common goals.

Emotional intelligence is crucial in the business world. As I consider people I consider to be both successful and ethical, they exude those core foundations of emotional intelligence, while being humble enough to identify areas where they have fallen short. Emphasis has tended to historically focused on an individual's intelligence quotient (IQ), while in more recent years, businesses have began to stress the value of a person's emotional quotient (EQ) for various reasons:

1. **Leadership:** Leaders with high EQ can inspire and motivate their teams, leading to increased productivity and employee satisfaction. Daniel Goleman is a primary figure who has emphasized the importance of EQ in leadership.

2. **Teamwork:** EI fosters better teamwork and collaboration. Understanding and respecting diverse perspectives within a team can lead to innovative solutions and better decision-making.

3. **Customer Relations:** Employees with high EQ are better equipped to handle customer interactions, resolving issues effectively and providing exceptional service.

4. **Conflict Resolution:** EQ helps in resolving conflicts diplomatically, reducing workplace tension, and maintaining a harmonious work environment.

By applying emotional intelligence in our workplaces, organizations can navigate cultural nuances successfully, foster trust, and achieve business success in increasingly diverse cultural environments. Developing emotional intelligence involves acknowledging and resolving these inner conflicts to make more informed and balanced choices. By implementing these strategies, individuals can minimize the tendency to take things personally, promote healthy communication, and build trust within a business context (as well as in our class' learning community).

### 01.03 | Clarify and Seek Understanding

When faced with a potentially offensive or unclear statement, don't immediately assume negative intent. Instead, ask for clarification or seek to understand the speaker's perspective. This proactive approach can prevent misunderstandings and build trust by demonstrating your willingness to engage in open and honest communication.

> Dialogue cannot exist in the absence of a profound love for the world and for people. The naming of the world, which is an act of creation and re-creation, is not possible if it is not infused with love. Love is at the same time the foundation of dialogue and dialogue itself.
>
> -- Paulo Freire

Clarifying and seeking understanding is crucial for fostering productive dialogue, mutual learning, and establishing ethical practices. Here are some ways we can achieve this:

1. **Active Listening**: When discussing topics, both parties should practice active listening. This allows for a better understanding of each other's perspectives.
2. **Open Dialogue**: Encourage open and honest discussions with each other. 
3. **Feedback Loops**: Create mechanisms for feedback from me and from other students in the class, such that we can receive constructive feedback. This helps in ensuring that we have the opportunity to learn from each other.

In the following movie clip from the movie The Princess Bride, Vizzini, a character known for his intelligence, repeatedly uses the word "inconceivable" to describe unexpected events or situations. However, as the events become increasingly unusual, Inigo Montoya, one of his companions, becomes frustrated and points out, "You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means."

!?[The Princess Bride - Inconceivable clip](https://youtu.be/D9MS2y2YU_o?si=ck4i3B00Gr7f_M9C)

Watching this exchange serves to reminder us all that effective communication requires not only speaking clearly but also seeking understanding and ensuring that the words used convey the intended meaning. It illustrates how misunderstandings can arise when individuals do not clarify or seek to understand the language and expressions used in communication. Promoting understanding and inclusivity between business people and students taking a business ethics class is vital for fostering ethical business practices, cultural sensitivity, and productive dialogues. It benefits both parties and contributes to a more ethical and responsible business environment.

### 01.04 | Separate feedback from identity

Learn to separate feedback or criticism from your self-worth. Constructive feedback is often about the task or the situation at hand and not a judgment of your character. Remember that feedback is an opportunity for growth and improvement, not a personal attack. Here's an example of feedback in a business context, just not a real one. In "The Office," Jim gets a formal warning about how much time he spends goofing around. When in fact, the people giving him the feedback tend to be unable to process their feelings toward Jim or communicate with him in an otherwise healthy way. 

!?[The Office clip: Jim gets his review](https://youtu.be/orm0sLYXSzw?si=FM9BNdMNttjW7niK)

This scene serves as a reminder that feedback should be constructive, objective, and focused on job-related performance. When feedback becomes intertwined with personal comments, it can hinder professional growth and create discomfort in the workplace. Someone who stressed the idea of this type of separation was Steve Jobs, the former CEO of Apple. 

> *"The only way to do great work is to love what you do and to detach your ego from the outcome."* 
>
> -- Steve Jobs

Separating feedback from our identity is vital for several reasons:

1. **Objective Self-Improvement**: When we detach feedback from our identity, we can view it more objectively. This allows us to focus on improving our actions, behaviors, or work without feeling personally attacked or defensive. It promotes a growth mindset, where we see feedback as a tool for personal development rather than a judgment of our worth.

2. **Effective Communication**: Feedback is meant to convey information about our actions or work. When feedback is tied to identity, it can lead to misunderstandings and defensive reactions. Detaching it from our identity makes it easier for both the giver and receiver to communicate effectively and ensure that the intended message is received.

3. **Reducing Emotional Impact**: Feedback that is closely tied to our identity can be emotionally taxing. It can lead to anxiety, stress, and a fear of failure. By separating feedback from our identity, we can reduce the emotional impact and maintain our mental well-being.

Yes, we recognize how important it is, but how do we do it? Here are some examples of how to separate feedback from our identity:

1. **Focus on Actions, Not Person**: When providing feedback, frame it in terms of actions, behaviors, or specific tasks rather than making it about the person. For example, say, "Your report lacks clarity," instead of "You're not a good writer."

2. **Use the "I" Statement**: When receiving feedback, encourage the giver to use "I" statements. For instance, "I found the presentation confusing" instead of "Your presentation was confusing." This shifts the focus to the individual's perspective rather than making it a general judgment.

3. **Embrace a Growth Mindset**: Cultivate a mindset that sees feedback as an opportunity for growth and learning. Understand that everyone makes mistakes and that feedback is a means to improve, not a reflection of your worth.

4. **Seek Clarification**: If feedback is vague or unclear, don't hesitate to ask for clarification. This allows you to better understand the specific areas that need improvement and prevents assumptions about your abilities.

5. **Practice Active Listening**: When receiving feedback, actively listen to the giver's perspective without immediately reacting emotionally. Take a moment to process the information before responding.

6. **Reflect on Feedback**: After receiving feedback, take some time to reflect on it. Consider whether it aligns with your goals and values. This can help you decide whether to incorporate the feedback into your actions or not.

7. **Separate Constructive from Destructive Feedback**: Learn to differentiate between constructive feedback (aimed at improvement) and destructive criticism (intended to harm or belittle). Focus on constructive feedback and disregard the latter. [^1] 

8. **Maintain Self-Esteem**: Remember that feedback does not define your self-worth. You can be a valuable person regardless of any specific feedback you receive. I find it especially helpful to consider the person providing me with the feedback and whether or not they are a worthwhile source from which I can grow and develop. 

Separating feedback from our identity is crucial for personal growth, effective communication, and emotional well-being. It allows us to learn from feedback without letting it define us.

[^1]: Those from historically marginalized populations may experience what is known as weathering, which refers to a phenomenon where individuals from marginalized racial and ethnic groups experience the cumulative effects of stress, discrimination, and microaggressions over time. This term was coined by Dr. Arline T. Geronimus in the early 1990s. 

### 01.05 | Be aware of cognitive dissonance

In order to develop emotional intelligence, it's crucial to be aware of cognitive dissonance, a psychological phenomenon where individuals experience discomfort due to conflicting beliefs or values. Watch this explainer from Concepts Unwrapped about Cognitive Dissonance: 

!?[Concepts Unwrapped - Cognitive dissonance video](https://youtu.be/m_lCO2cBNts?si=FOTnpfcSHLs0iTTE)

As shared in the video, cognitive dissonance is a psychological concept that refers to the discomfort or tension that arises when an individual holds two contradictory beliefs, attitudes, or values, or when their actions are inconsistent with their beliefs. This state of mental conflict can lead to feelings of discomfort and the desire to reduce or eliminate this dissonance. 

Recognizing cognitive dissonance in a business context is crucial for several reasons:

1. **Decision-Making**: In business, leaders and employees make numerous decisions daily, and many of these decisions involve trade-offs and conflicting information. When individuals experience cognitive dissonance, it can cloud their judgment and lead to suboptimal decision-making.

2. **Employee Satisfaction and Engagement**: Employees may experience cognitive dissonance when their personal values or beliefs conflict with the actions or policies of their organization. This can result in decreased job satisfaction, disengagement, and even turnover.

3. **Consumer Behavior**: Understanding how cognitive dissonance influences consumer behavior is essential for businesses. Consumers often experience dissonance when they make a purchase that conflicts with their beliefs or when they are exposed to conflicting information in advertising. Recognizing and addressing this can impact customer loyalty and brand perception.

Our brains want things to make sense and will make every attempt to have that be the case, including when we experience cognitive dissonance. The ways people may attempt to reduce or eliminate cognitive dissonance include: 

1. **Changing Beliefs or Attitudes**: One way to reduce cognitive dissonance is by altering one's beliefs or attitudes to align with their actions. For instance, an employee might rationalize unethical behavior by changing their beliefs about the importance of ethical conduct in business.

2. **Seeking Information**: People often seek additional information or evidence that supports their actions or beliefs to reduce dissonance. In a business context, this can involve looking for data that justifies a particular decision or course of action.

3. **Selective Exposure**: Individuals may avoid information that contradicts their beliefs or actions, a phenomenon known as selective exposure. In business, this can manifest as ignoring negative feedback or avoiding dissenting opinions.

4. **Compromise**: Sometimes, individuals find a middle ground that allows them to reconcile conflicting beliefs or actions. In a business context, this might involve compromising on certain values to achieve a specific goal.

5. **Social Validation**: Seeking validation from peers or colleagues who share similar beliefs or actions can help reduce cognitive dissonance. In business, this can lead to groupthink or conformity within an organization.

Recognizing cognitive dissonance and its impact in a business context is essential for effective decision-making, employee satisfaction, and maintaining a positive corporate culture. Acknowledging diverse perspectives on how cognitive dissonance is experienced and resolved can lead to more comprehensive strategies for managing it in the workplace.

This lesson has delved into the definition and importance of ethics, emphasizing not taking things personally and placing the Imago Dei at the center of our interactions. We have learned that true growth lies in holding each other accountable for developing emotional intelligence, fostering an environment of empathy and understanding. Moreover, we have recognized the significance of separating feedback from identity, allowing us to grow without fear of judgment. Finally, our exploration has highlighted the critical need to be aware of cognitive dissonance, a powerful tool in aligning our actions with our ethical principles. As we reflect on these lessons, let us strive to embody these principles in our daily lives, creating a more compassionate and ethical world for ourselves and those around us.

![Course header graphic - lesson 02](https://innovatelearning.s3.amazonaws.com/busn435-course-header-lesson-02.jpg)

Before we get to study applied business ethics (in the context of an organization or industry), it is important to establish a firm foundation. Let's first delve into the ideas and philosophies of influential thinkers who have shaped ethical thought over centuries. 

> What are the fundamental principles that guide ethical decision-making in business? How do different philosophical perspectives offer unique insights into corporate responsibility, sustainability, and social justice? 

By getting to know these philosophers (and some associated ethical frameworks), we will gain a deeper understanding of the ethical complexities that arise in the business world and how to navigate them effectively. The good news is that we aren't going alone.

### 02.01 | Road trip: We're going to Harvard

![LEGO depiction of a road trip to Harvard University - a group of students about to hop in a VW bus](https://innovatelearning.s3.amazonaws.com/busn435-lego-bricks-01-roadtrip.png)

Buckle up, as we are about to embark on a virtual road trip to the intellectual haven that is Harvard University! Now, don't get too excited, we won't be donning crimson robes and walking the hallowed grounds, but we will getting to make a visit to see the brilliant [Michael Sandel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Sandel) and his thought-provoking Justice course, which has been taken by more than 15,000 students[^1].

During our virtual visit, we'll also be meeting some of the biggest names in philosophy, like [Immanuel Kant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant), [John Stuart Mill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stuart_Mill), and [John Rawls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rawls). These philosophers have left their intellectual mark all over the study of ethics, and we'll be exploring how they guide our moral compasses in the complex world of business.

We are going to be looking at the intriguing "Moral Side of Murder" lecture from Sandel's course. This isn't a murder mystery, but a journey into the ethical intricacies that make us question our deepest beliefs. It's a wild ride that will challenge our moral intuitions and spark lively debates.

As we travel (at least in our imaginations) to Harvard's campus and experience Sandel's excellent teaching style, which is modeled off of Socrates (another philosopher we'll be meeting), let's remember the following timeless wisdom from that very same philosopher: 

> "An unexamined life is not worth living."
>
> -- Socrates

 Our trip to Harvard will guide us on a voyage (dare I say road trip? 😂) of self-discovery, where we'll uncover the right path to ethical decision-making in the business world. 

[^1]: According to [an oped (opinion piece) by Thomas L. Friedman](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/15/opinion/15friedman.html) in the New York Times. 

### 02.02 | The moral side of murder and the case for cannibalism

Episode One of Sandel's Justice class considers how effectively utilitarianism helps us use utility for decision making and inquires as to whether it helps us arrive at the right answer. In the first half of his lecture, Michael Sandel presents a hypothetical scenario to his students: Would you kill one person to save the lives of five others? Is it the right thing to do? This scenario launches a discussion on moral reasoning and the complexity of making ethical decisions in extreme situations.

> If you had to choose between (1) killing one person to save the lives of five others and (2) doing nothing even though you knew that five people would die right before your eyes if you did nothing—what would you do?  What would be the right thing to do?

Yes, that sounds pretty heavy there. But Michael Sandel keeps the Harvard lecture hall laughing, as you will see in the video. One of the most memorable parts of this class for past students has been getting to see inside one of the largest lecture halls at Harvard and to see how the students there respond to his questions. 

In the second half of this thought-provoking video, Michael Sandel delves into the ethical principles of renowned utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Bentham. To bring Bentham into our minds in a memorable way, Sandel introduces a well-known nineteenth-century legal case that unfolds as a shipwrecked crew of four individuals faces an agonizing dilemma. After enduring nineteen days adrift at sea, the captain makes a morally complex decision – to sacrifice the life of the weakest member, a young cabin boy, to ensure the survival of the rest by consuming his blood and body. 

> Suppose you find yourself in a situation in which killing an innocent person is the only way to prevent many innocent people from dying. What’s the right thing to do? This question arose in The Queen v. Dudley and Stephens (1884), a famous English law case involving four men stranded in a lifeboat without food or water. How should we judge the action of Dudley and Stephens? Was it morally justified or morally wrong?

This captivating case serves as a catalyst for an engaging classroom debate in this most-popular class at Harvard, challenging the moral validity of utilitarianism and its doctrine that deems "the greatest good for the greatest number" as the ultimate ethical guideline. Join us as we explore this profound moral inquiry and grapple with the complexities of ethical decision-making.

### 02.03 | What if everybody did that? 

I was about to tell you about this super irritating book that our kids used to love to have me read when they were little. However, upon doing some digging, turns out that you can experience it for yourself. Actually, the woman who reads is has quite an easy to listen to cadence in her read aloud. Looking back, perhaps it was just my reading of it that was irritating, when our kids were little? 

> Watch at least enough of the [What If Everybody Did That video](https://youtu.be/SD0apYFz5gg?si=ax2s7e4rPSG0M9YH) to get the gist of the main theme of the book, which was derived straight from our next philosopher: Immanuel Kant. 

!?[What If Everybody Did That? Book read aloud](https://youtu.be/SD0apYFz5gg?si=ax2s7e4rPSG0M9YH)

We can learn a bit about this philosopher from the openly-licensed textbook [Introduction to Philosophy: Ethics](https://press.rebus.community/intro-to-phil-ethics/chapter/kantian-deontology/) and the section on Immanuel Kant, where they share that: 

> Relative to most other philosophers, Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) was a late bloomer, publishing his first significant work, *The Critique of Pure Reason*, in 1781 at age 57. 

![Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) by Johann Gottlieb Becker via Wikimedia Commons. This work is in the public domain.](https://press.rebus.community/app/uploads/sites/147/2019/09/image2-1.jpg)

> Some of the main questions that Kant’s ethics focuses on are questions of right and wrong: What makes an action right or wrong? Which actions are we required by morality to perform? Do consequences matter? Is it ever permissible to do something morally wrong in order to achieve good consequences? Is it important to do actions with good intentions? And what are good intentions? Some of Kant’s answers to some of these questions are complex, but as we will see, he doesn’t think that consequences matter and thus good consequences cannot justify wrong actions. He also thinks that intentions are important to the ethical evaluation of actions.

Let's get to know Immanuel Kant, by watching a short video from  [Three Minute Philosophy: Immanuel Kant](https://youtu.be/xwOCmJevigw?si=rQHOJ8mdJF_KzijA).

### 02.04 | Get real with John Rawls, y'all!

Another philosopher we are definitely going to want to know is John Rawls, in our study of business ethics. John Rawls continues to this day to be influential in the field of political philosophy, particularly his theory of justice. Here are some key points that business ethics students should know about John Rawls:

1. **Theory of Justice:** John Rawls is most renowned for his theory of justice as fairness, which he presented in his book "A Theory of Justice" published in 1971. This theory provides a framework for understanding what constitutes a just and fair society.

2. **Original Position and Veil of Ignorance:** Rawls introduces the concept of the original position, a hypothetical state in which rational individuals make decisions about the principles of justice. These individuals are behind a "veil of ignorance," meaning they don't know their own personal attributes, such as their gender, race, social status, or wealth. This ensures that the principles of justice they choose are fair and impartial.

3. **Two Principles of Justice:** Rawls proposes two principles of justice that individuals in the original position would agree upon:
   - **First Principle (Equal Basic Liberties):** This principle states that each person should have an equal right to the most extensive basic liberties that are compatible with similar liberties for all.
   - **Second Principle (Difference Principle):** This principle allows for social and economic inequalities as long as they benefit the least advantaged members of society. In other words, inequalities should be structured to improve the situation of the most vulnerable.

4. **Maximin Principle:** Rawls argues for a maximin approach, which means that decisions should be made to maximize the well-being of the least advantaged in society. This reflects his emphasis on social justice and reducing inequality.

It is time to further explore what John Rawls called the veil of ignorance. The Veil of Ignorance is a device for helping people more fairly envision a fair society (or business) by pretending that they are ignorant of their personal circumstances. Watch [this short video from Ethics Defined about the veil of ignorance](https://youtu.be/qWSYpiE54cg?si=RV2wS22aUeZWQd55). 

!?[Veil of ignorance | Ethics defined](https://youtu.be/qWSYpiE54cg?si=U1bnJkVSZHdD1YEw)

> And fairness, as Rawls and many others believe, is the essence of justice. 



In a business context, we can apply Rawls' ideas to ethical dilemmas. Rawls' emphasis on fairness, equal opportunities, and addressing the needs of the least advantaged can inform decisions business leaders make regarding corporate social responsibility, fair wages, and ethical business practices. There are critiques and debates surrounding Rawls' theory, including criticisms of the feasibility of implementing his principles in the real world and concerns about the balance between individual liberty and social equality. This takes us back to the grey areas of studying ethics. John Rawls' theory of justice provides a foundational framework for thinking about fairness and ethical decision-making in society, including its relevance to business practices and corporate ethics. Understanding Rawls' ideas can help us engage in discussions about ethical dilemmas in the business world from a broader philosophical perspective.

### 02.05 | Aristotle meets Batman

Ready to meet our last philosopher? Well, at least for this lesson? Aristotle, an ancient Greek philosopher, laid the groundwork for virtue ethics, a philosophical approach that has enduring relevance in the field of business ethics. His profound insights into human nature and ethics continue to guide individuals and organizations in making ethical decisions. Aristotle believed that the ultimate purpose of human life is to achieve eudaimonia, often translated as "happiness" or "flourishing." Virtue ethics, as expounded by Aristotle, centers on the development of virtuous character traits as a means to attain this state of well-being. 

> Virtue Ethics is a normative philosophical approach that urges people to live a moral life by cultivating virtuous habits.
>
> -- Ethics Unwrapped from McCombs School of Business at the University of Texas

A cornerstone of Aristotle's virtue ethics is the idea of virtues and the golden mean. Virtues, such as courage, honesty, and justice, are character traits that contribute to both individual and societal well-being. Aristotle proposed that virtues lie between two extremes, with the golden mean representing the balanced and virtuous path. For example, courage is the space between recklessness and cowardice. Watch [this short video from McCombs School of Business Ethics Unwrapped](https://youtu.be/NMblKpkKYao?si=bfSjGM0WKXxXuAt_) to explore more about virtue ethics. 

!?[Virtue ethics | Ethics defined](https://youtu.be/NMblKpkKYao?si=HBTUMDsa7BtyibW9)

Virtue ethics is all about living a morally upright life through character development. This approach suggests that practicing virtues like honesty, bravery, and generosity leads to a virtuous character. Aristotle believed that these virtuous habits help individuals make ethical choices when faced with dilemmas. In the clip, we learn how to clarify the differences between moral philosophies, by considering the film The Dark Knight. Utilitarians might support Batman killing the Joker to save others, while deontologists would reject it solely because killing is wrong. In contrast, virtue ethicists focus on Batman's character, asking if he wants to become someone who takes lives. The answer is usually no. Virtue ethics teaches us how to be virtuous individuals and provides guidance for ethical living without rigid rules for specific dilemmas we might face.

## 03. Decide how we decide when we decide

![Course lesson graphic 01](https://innovatelearning.s3.amazonaws.com/busn435-course-header-lesson-03.jpg)

When I was earning my doctorate, one of our professors would regularly emphasize the importance of deciding how we were going to decide something as a group, before we actually made any specific decision. As easy as that may sound, we weren't always very disciplined about doing it and conflict or group confusion would arise, because of us not having determined our process, in advance. 

> We are going to be going through a case study that will help you think about how you might make a decision, in the case where it wasn't obvious what the right thing to do was. Again, it is easier than it seems. Use the links on Canvas to access the case and follow the directions for working in groups for the second half. 

You are going to want to stop reading at this point and head over to Canvas, as otherwise the "ending" may be spoiled for the case and it won't be as meaningful or fun. Be sure you have finished part 1 of the case, before returning here to our open textbook.

### 03.01 | Ethical frameworks

Let's start with why everyone hates moral philosophy professors, or otherwise getting us to laugh a bit to warm up our brains to discover more about ethical frameworks. In this clip, The Good Place Channel does a mashup of two tv shows, both of which focus on philosophy: 

!?[Philosophy according to Jack and Chidi - The Good Place and AP Bio's mashup](https://youtu.be/EQpkNxP7BxI?si=_GCs_XRryamqO-TV)

Ethical frameworks are systems of moral principles or guidelines that help individuals and organizations make ethical decisions and evaluate the moral implications of their actions. These frameworks provide a structured approach to navigating complex ethical dilemmas by offering a set of principles, rules, or perspectives to consider when facing moral choices.

You explored some of the ethical frameworks, as you were going through the case study. Several ethical frameworks exist, each with its own principles and approaches to ethical decision making. Let's explore some examples of ethical frameworks

#### Consequentialism: Weighing actions by their outcomes

This framework asserts that the morality of an action is determined by its outcomes or consequences. Let's look at an example of a company who took a look at the outcomes of their decisions and the resulting impacts on the plant. 

> Patagonia, an outdoor apparel and gear company, decided to shift its entire product line to use recycled materials, emphasizing environmental sustainability. This decision was made in line with their consequentialist approach, focusing on the positive outcomes for the planet.

!?[What's next? | Patagonia](https://youtu.be/eV_753wIUzo?si=NaOPwnl3jRpR03kV)

> Patagonia's commitment to using recycled materials led to reduced environmental impact, increased brand loyalty among environmentally-conscious consumers, and positive financial results. The company's decision aligned with consequentialist ethics, as it resulted in both ecological benefits and improved profitability.

**Utilitarianism**, a specific form of consequentialism, emphasizes maximizing overall happiness or minimizing suffering. Individuals following consequentialist ethics will consider the potential consequences of their actions and choose the course of action that results in the greatest good for the greatest number.

Of course, businesses haven't always been focused on attaining good outcomes for stakeholders, or the planet. Let's look at a less-than-ideal consequentialist decision making approach, from the company Enron. 

> Enron, once a leading energy company, engaged in unethical accounting practices to inflate its financial statements, a decision driven by a consequentialist approach aimed at maximizing shareholder value.

!?[Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room movie trailer](https://youtu.be/-w6duQhWuVk?si=bCrSX1JDe7uW1Znk)

> The consequentialist pursuit of immediate profits through fraudulent accounting eventually led to the collapse of Enron. Thousands of employees lost their jobs and life savings, and investors suffered significant financial losses. Enron's unethical actions, driven by a narrow focus on short-term gains, had catastrophic consequences for all stakeholders involved.

These examples illustrate how consequentialist decision-making in business can result in both positive and negative outcomes, depending on the ethical considerations and long-term consequences taken into account.

#### Deontology: The moral compass of duties and principles

Deontological ethics focuses on the inherent nature of actions rather than their outcomes. It emphasizes adherence to moral rules or duties, irrespective of the consequences. **Immanuel Kant's categorical imperative** is a well-known deontological approach that encourages individuals to act according to principles that could be universally applied without contradiction.

> In the early 1980s, Johnson & Johnson faced a severe crisis when some bottles of their Tylenol product were tampered with, resulting in multiple deaths. The company's decision to recall all Tylenol products from store shelves and redesign packaging to prevent tampering aligns with deontological ethics.

Let's explore more from [Introduction to Philosophy: Ethics chapter on Kantian Deontology](https://press.rebus.community/intro-to-phil-ethics/chapter/kantian-deontology/): 

> One of the distinctive features of Kant’s ethics is that it focuses on duties, defined by right and wrong. Right and wrong (which are the primary deontic categories, along with obligatory, optional, supererogatory, and others) are distinct from good and bad (which are value categories) in that they directly prescribe actions: right actions are ones we ought to do (are morally required to do) and wrong actions we ought not to do (are morally forbidden from doing). This style of ethics is referred to as deontology. The name comes from the Greek word *deon*, meaning duty or obligation. In deontology, the deontic categories are primary, while value determinations are derived from them. 
>
> Kant believes all our duties can be derived from the categorical imperative. We’ll first need to explain what Kant means by the phrase “categorical imperative” and then we’ll look at the content of this rule.
>
> First, Kant believes that morality must be rational. He models his morality on science, which seeks to discover universal laws that govern the natural world. Similarly, morality will be a system of universal rules that govern action. In Kant’s view, as we will see, right action is ultimately a rational action. As an ethics of duty, Kant believes that ethics consists of commands about what we ought to do. The word “imperative” in his categorical imperative means a command or order. However, unlike most other commands, which usually come from some authority, these commands come from within, from our own reason. Still, they function the same way: they are commands to do certain actions.
>
> Kant distinguishes two types of imperatives: hypothetical and categorical imperatives. 
>
> A hypothetical imperative is a contingent command. It’s conditional on a person’s wants, needs, or desires and normally comes in the following form: “If you want/need A, then you ought to do B.” For example, the advice, “If you want to do well on a test, then you should study a lot” would be a hypothetical imperative. The command that you study is contingent on your desire to do well on the test. Other examples are, “If you are thirsty, drink water,” or “If you want to be in better shape, you should exercise.” Such commands are more like advice on how to accomplish our goals than moral rules. If you don’t have a particular want, desire, or goal, then a hypothetical imperative doesn’t apply. For example, if you don’t want to be in better shape, then the hypothetical imperative that you should exercise, doesn’t apply to you.
>
> A genuinely moral imperative would not be contingent on wants, desires, or needs, and this is what is meant by a categorical imperative. A categorical imperative, instead of taking an if-then form, is an absolute command, such as, “Do A,” or “You ought to do A.” Examples of categorical imperatives would be “You shouldn’t kill,” “You ought to help those in need,” or “Don’t steal.” It doesn’t matter what your wants or goals are; you should follow a categorical imperative no matter what.
>
> But these aren’t *the* categorical imperative. Kant believes that there is one categorical imperative that is the most important and that should guide all of our actions. This is the ultimate categorical imperative from which all other moral rules are derived. This categorical imperative can be expressed in several different ways, and Kant presents three formulations of it in *The Groundwork*.
>
> #### THE FIRST FORMULATION OF THE CATEGORICAL IMPERATIVE
>
> The underlying idea behind the first formulation of the categorical imperative is that moral rules are supposed to be universal laws. If we think of comparable laws, such as scientific laws like the law of gravitational attraction or Newton’s three laws of motion, they are universal and apply to all people equally, no matter who they are or what their needs are. If our moral rules are to be rational, then they should have the same form.
>
> From this idea, Kant derives his first formulation of the categorical imperative, “act only in accordance with that maxim through which you can at the same time will that it become a universal law."
>
> First, we must explain this word “maxim.” 
>
> What Kant means by a maxim is a personal rule or a general principle that underlies a particular action. As rational beings, we don’t just act randomly; we devise certain rules that tell us what to do in different circumstances. A complete maxim will include three pieces: the action, the circumstances under which we do that action, and the purpose behind that action. For example, the maxim explaining why you’re reading this book, if it’s an assigned text, might be, “I will read all books assigned for class because I want to succeed in class.” Different principles could underlie the same action. For example, you might be reading this book simply to help you understand the topic, in which case your principle might be, “When I am confused about a topic, I will read an accessible text to improve my understanding.” The important point is that we are guided by general principles that we give to ourselves, that tell us what we’ll do in certain circumstances.
>
> The first formulation, thus, is a test of whether any particular maxim should be followed or not. We test a maxim by universalizing it, that is, by asking if it would be possible for everyone to live by this maxim. If the maxim can be universalized, meaning that it’s possible that everyone could live by it, then it’s permissible to follow it. If it can’t be universalized, then it is impermissible to follow it. The logic of the universalization test is that any rule you follow should apply to everyone—there’s nothing special about you that allows you to be an exception.
>
> To look at some examples, imagine you need money to pay off some debts. You go to a friend to borrow the money and tell this friend that you will pay him back. You know you won’t be able to pay your friend back, but you promise him nonetheless. You are making a false promise. Is this permissible? To test, we first look at the maxim underlying the action, something like, “If I need something, I’ll make a false promise in order to get what I need.” What would happen if everyone were to make false promises every time they needed something? False promises would be rampant, so rampant that promises would become meaningless; they would just be empty words. For this reason, the maxim can’t be universalized. The maxim included the idea of making a promise, but if, when universalized, promises cease to have any meaning, then we couldn’t really make a promise. Since the maxim can’t be universalized, we shouldn’t follow it, and thus we derive the duty to not make false promises.
>
> We should note that Kant’s universalization test is not asking whether universalizing a maxim would lead to undesirable consequences. Kant is not claiming that making a false promise is wrong because we wouldn’t want to live in a world where no one kept their promises. It’s wrong because it’s not possible to universalize the maxim. It’s not possible because it leads to a contradiction. In this case, the contradiction is in the concept of a promise: that it becomes meaningless when universalized. We can see this with other maxims. If you’re thinking of stealing something, the maxim underlying this action might be something like, “I’ll steal the things I want so I can have what I want.” If everyone were to follow this maxim, then the concept of ownership would cease to have any meaning, and if nothing were owned, then how would it be possible to steal? To steal means to take someone else’s property without permission, and this is where the contradiction comes in. It’s not possible to steal if nothing belongs to anyone. Thus, it’s not possible to universalize this maxim, and we thereby get the duty that we shouldn’t steal. Both of these contradictions are what Kant calls “contradictions in conception.”
>
> Another example Kant gives is of our obligation to help out others. Suppose you could help people but didn’t want to. Your maxim might be, “I will never help out anyone else since everyone should be independent.” If this were universalized, then everyone would be completely independent, with no one asking for, nor offering help. However, we wouldn’t be able to live in a world where no one helps anyone because we’ll inevitably sometimes need others’ help. The contradiction in this case is a practical contradiction, “a contradiction in will,” as Kant calls it. In this case, we would eventually have to break the maxim due to our need for help. Thus, from this, we get the duty that we should sometimes help out others in need.

!?[Managing the Tylenol crisis](https://youtu.be/jtuvgAkKGqM?si=miUaNQTCcFNG9Lz5)

> Johnson & Johnson's decision reflects the principles of Kant's Categorical Imperative, particularly the principle of treating individuals as ends in themselves, not as means to an end. By prioritizing customer safety over short-term profit, the company demonstrated a commitment to ethical duty and the well-being of its consumers. Johnson & Johnson's ethical response to the Tylenol crisis not only saved lives but also enhanced their reputation as a responsible and trustworthy company. While the short-term financial cost was significant, their deontological approach led to long-term benefits in terms of customer trust and brand loyalty.

While Johnson & Johnson can celebrate the choices they made to support a trustworthy brand, other companies have not faired so well and have not acted in accordance to their values. 

> VW faced a scandal when it was revealed that they had intentionally installed software in their diesel vehicles to manipulate emissions test results, prioritizing short-term profits over environmental and regulatory obligations.

!?[Volkswagen's emissions scandal: A timeline](https://youtu.be/Y5TvFY7xRDM?si=osBvzDn4EQ1Y8eht)

> VW's actions in the emissions scandal directly contradict Kant's Categorical Imperative. They treated regulators and consumers merely as means to achieve financial gain, disregarding their moral duty to act honestly and ethically. Kant's principle of universalizability suggests that VW's actions would lead to a world where companies routinely deceive regulators and customers, undermining trust in the industry. The scandal resulted in substantial fines, lawsuits, and damage to VW's reputation. The company's deontological violation of ethical principles not only harmed its brand but also raised questions about corporate responsibility and trust in the automotive industry.

These contrasting examples serve as vivid illustrations of the profound impact ethical frameworks can have on business decisions. While Johnson & Johnson's deontological commitment to consumer safety, as exemplified in their response to the Tylenol crisis, showcased the enduring importance of moral duty and the Kantian Categorical Imperative, Volkswagen's transgressions revealed the devastating consequences of forsaking ethical principles for short-term gains. 

These cases underscore that in the complex landscape of business ethics, adherence to deontological principles, such as treating individuals as ends in themselves, not as means to an end, is not only a matter of moral duty but also a path towards enduring trust, credibility, and long-term success in the corporate world. In the ever-evolving business landscape, the lessons drawn from these cases remain both instructive and cautionary, inviting us to continually examine the ethical foundations that guide our decisions and actions.

#### Virtue Ethics: Cultivating excellence in character

Virtue ethics places importance on the development of virtuous character traits. It suggests that ethical behavior arises from cultivating virtues like honesty, courage, compassion, and integrity. Instead of following strict rules, individuals using this framework strive to embody virtuous qualities. 

> The Body Shop, a cosmetics and skincare company, has long been committed to ethical and environmentally responsible practices. They prioritize sourcing natural ingredients sustainably and supporting fair trade. This aligns with the virtue ethics approach, emphasizing virtues like environmental stewardship and social responsibility.

!?[At 40, The Body Shop becomes most ethical, sustainable global business](https://youtu.be/nbe-8Y6NfMg?si=mWzTzCV2wTiE3BB9)

> The Body Shop's dedication to virtue ethics has led to a positive brand image, increased customer loyalty, and a reputation for promoting ethical and sustainable business practices. Their commitment to virtues such as integrity, compassion, and environmental consciousness has not only been good for their bottom line but has also made a positive impact on the world.

On an entirely different side of the equation, Wells Fargo faced a scandal when it was revealed that the bank had created millions of fake accounts for customers without their consent, driven by a culture that prioritized aggressive sales targets and short-term profits over ethical virtues.

!?[How high up did the Wells Fargo fake accounts go?](https://youtu.be/wHYYUtoPA4s?si=wa17AXVYykF3f4Mw)

> The unethical behavior at Wells Fargo had severe consequences, including significant financial penalties, damage to the bank's reputation, and the loss of customer trust. This incident serves as a stark reminder that even established organizations can falter when they lose sight of virtue ethics and prioritize profits over integrity and customer well-being.

In the realm of business ethics, virtue ethics stands as a beacon of principled conduct, emphasizing the cultivation of virtuous character traits and ethical values. The Body Shop's unwavering commitment to sustainability and fair trade practices exemplifies how virtue ethics can lead to a positive and enduring impact, fostering trust and loyalty among consumers. Conversely, the Wells Fargo scandal serves as a cautionary tale, illustrating the perils of abandoning virtue ethics for short-term gains. Just as superheroes in the movies often uphold moral virtues to protect the greater good, businesses that prioritize ethical virtues create lasting legacies, while those that falter risk facing their own moral reckoning.

#### Rights-Based Ethics: Upholding fundamental human rights

Rights-based ethics, often associated with the work of philosophers like **John Locke** and **John Stuart Mill**, emphasizes individual rights and freedoms. It asserts that ethical actions are those that respect and protect the rights of individuals, such as the right to life, liberty, and property. 

> Ben & Jerry's, an ice cream company, has long been an advocate for social justice and sustainability. They prioritize supporting various social causes, including fair labor practices and environmental responsibility. This aligns with rights-based ethics, which places a strong emphasis on respecting and upholding the rights of individuals and communities.

!?[How Ben & Jerry’s Activism Helps Scoop Up Customers](https://youtu.be/-L0QyO8SClY?si=IinPwRM1hwgnN-Vw)

> Ben & Jerry's commitment to rights-based ethics has not only cultivated a loyal customer base but has also created a positive impact on society. They actively support fair labor practices, ethical sourcing of ingredients, and community engagement, reflecting their dedication to respecting the rights of workers, farmers, and consumers. Their success demonstrates how adhering to rights-based ethics can lead to both profitability and social progress.

Let's contrast Ben & Jerry's commitment to rights-based ethics to the contrasting case of Nike. While Ben & Jerry's has exemplified how upholding the rights and well-being of workers and communities can foster a positive brand image and drive social progress, the story of Nike underscores the repercussions a company can face when neglecting these fundamental rights. 

> Nike faced significant controversy in the 1990s when reports revealed poor working conditions and low wages in overseas factories where their products were manufactured. The company's prioritization of cost reduction and profit maximization over the rights and well-being of factory workers conflicted with rights-based ethics. 
>
> Nike's violation of rights-based ethics led to widespread protests, boycotts, and damage to its reputation. The negative consequences, including public outrage and legal challenges, served as a stark reminder that disregarding the rights of workers can have severe repercussions for businesses.

The clothes we wear pose an opportunity for human rights violations to occur, as the Nike example shows. An undercover BBC investigation uncovered a distressing reality. Syrian refugee children were found laboring in Turkish factories, producing clothing for prominent British retailers, including Marks and Spencer and online giant ASOS. While these brands assert their strong stance against exploitation and child labor, this report sheds light on the complex issues surrounding labor rights and ethical responsibility within the global supply chain. This disconcerting revelation echoes the concerns raised in the case of Nike's past labor controversies.

!?[Undercover: The refugees who make our clothes - BBC](https://youtu.be/3tf6qc51Kbw?si=xP_iEDBYCBjo4TV7) 

When it comes to business ethics, the lens of rights-based ethics remains a powerful guide, emphasizing the importance of respecting and upholding the fundamental rights of individuals and communities. Ben & Jerry's commitment to social justice and sustainability showcases how adhering to rights-based ethics can not only foster customer loyalty but also drive positive change in society. 

Conversely, Nike's past missteps and the fast fashion industry as a whole underscore the enduring impact of disregarding workers' rights, serving as a cautionary tale for businesses that prioritize profit over ethical responsibility. Just as iconic heroes in literature and cinema champion justice and individual rights, businesses that embrace rights-based ethics have the potential to make a lasting, positive impact on the world while safeguarding their own moral integrity.



#### Social Contract Theory: Navigating morality in collective agreements 

This ethical framework, popularized by thinkers like **Thomas Hobbes** and **Jean-Jacques Rousseau**, posits that ethical norms and rules emerge from social agreements and contracts. It emphasizes the importance of following agreed-upon rules for the stability and well-being of society.

> Starbucks has a longstanding commitment to social responsibility and sustainability. They prioritize fair trade practices, ethical sourcing, and community engagement, aligning with the principles of social contract theory. By respecting the implicit social contract between businesses and society, Starbucks has fostered a positive reputation and customer loyalty.

!?[Follow Starbucks 15 Year Journey to 100% Ethically Sourced Coffee](https://youtu.be/X9g6Z0FYTn8?si=7zJss1EFo9UtqCyQ)

> Starbucks' dedication to social contract theory has led to a positive impact on both their brand and the communities they serve. They actively contribute to the well-being of coffee farmers, support local initiatives, and engage in environmentally friendly practices. This commitment has not only boosted their bottom line but has also solidified their role as a responsible corporate citizen.

One thing careful observers will notice about the Starbucks video is that it was produced by their own media people. While there is nothing wrong with promoting your values as a company to the public (and I do enjoy iced tea from Starbucks on a regular basis), I did a bit more digging and found this [rating for the Starbucks Corporation on the Ethical Consumer website.](https://www.ethicalconsumer.org/company-profile/starbucks-corporation), which didn't place them in as positive of a light. The Ethical Consumer is a UK-based non-profit research, political, and advocacy-oriented publisher which rates companies on their ethical and environmental behavior. 

Let's just say not everyone is going to praise Starbucks for their adherence to social contract theory and environmental and social consciousness. For now, I'm going to keep drinking my iced teas, while also recognizing when I make purchases, I'm voting with our family's finances about the degree to which I'm going to support what a given company does. These are not easy choices and we should all resist thinking in dichotomous ways. 

A company that has had their share of controversy regarding their business practices is Facebook, which was founded by Mark Zuckerberg. Facebook faced public backlash due to issues related to user data privacy and data breaches. Their actions, which disregarded user consent and the implicit social contract of trust, conflicted with the principles of social contract theory.

!?[How Cambridge Analytics exploited the Facebook data of millions](https://youtu.be/mrnXv-g4yKU?si=yGxiYpwi1mmIbMcx)

> Facebook's disregard for the social contract through the Cambridge Analytics scandal and other data breaches have led to public outrage, government investigations, and a loss of user trust. The negative consequences, including legal repercussions and damage to the company's reputation, underscored the importance of respecting the trust and expectations inherent in the social contract between technology companies and their users.

Social contract theory serves as a guiding principle, highlighting the importance of honoring the unspoken agreements between businesses and society. Starbucks' espoused commitment to ethical practices and community engagement exemplifies how adhering to the principles of the social contract can lead to both business success and positive societal impact. Conversely, Facebook's lapses in data privacy and trust demonstrate the profound consequences of neglecting the social contract, serving as a cautionary tale for companies that overlook their responsibilities to their users and the broader community. Businesses that uphold the social contract have the potential to thrive while contributing to the greater good of the communities they serve.

### 03.02 | Why bother learning about ethical frameworks

Before the COVID pandemic hit the world in early 2020, I used to think that all the exercises used to consider ethical frameworks were too theoretical and not realistic enough. I remember while earning my graduate degrees being presented with fictitious cases involving being on a life boat with just two matches, a hot dog, and 22 cotton swabs and trying to determine who was going to get to live. 

I no longer believe that those cases were that far off. More than ever, I find it essential to recognize the ways in which we are using ethical frameworks to guide our decision making and when those values may be in conflict with other people we are collaborating with regarding a decision. Ethical frameworks are essential to learn about for several reasons.

**Guidance and structure for ethical decision making**

Ethical frameworks provide guidance and structure for evaluating ethical dilemmas and making consistent and principled decisions. For instance, when Apple Inc. faced the ethical dilemma of balancing user privacy with national security in the case of the San Bernardino terrorist attack, ethical frameworks helped them navigate the situation. Apple's decision to prioritize user privacy aligns with principles of individual rights, a key aspect of ethical frameworks.

**Consistency in ethical choices**

Ethical frameworks promote consistency in decision making, ensuring that organizations uphold their ethical values regardless of the situation. In the corporate world, companies like Patagonia consistently prioritize environmental sustainability in their business practices. This alignment with their values, guided by ethical principles, has resulted in long-term trust and loyalty from customers who appreciate their ethical stance.

**Clarity of values and principles**

Ethical frameworks help individuals and organizations clarify their core values and principles. For instance, when Johnson & Johnson faced the Tylenol tampering crisis in the 1980s, the company's swift and ethical response demonstrated their commitment to the safety and well-being of consumers. By recalling all Tylenol products and redesigning packaging for tamper resistance, Johnson & Johnson showcased their ethical values and commitment to customer safety. This crisis management strategy aligned with their principles and communicated their ethical stance clearly to the public.

**Accountability for actions**

Understanding ethical frameworks holds individuals and organizations accountable for their actions. A notable case is Enron, where corporate leaders engaged in unethical accounting practices. The Enron scandal led to legal consequences and ethical discussions, highlighting the importance of accountability in the business world.

**Promotion of critical thinking**

Ethical frameworks encourage critical thinking by requiring individuals to consider multiple perspectives. In the film "12 Angry Men," jurors are faced with the ethical dilemma of a murder trial. Through rigorous debate and examination of evidence, they employ ethical reasoning to arrive at a just verdict. This scene of Juror #3 breaking down and pronouncing his decision of "not guilty," illustrates the ways in which ethical frameworks promote critical thinking in decision making and how one person can courageously challenge the status quo.

!?[12 angry men movie clip](https://youtu.be/0jxVnlRdelU?si=lRUe1H41x_Z9el9G)

It's easy for us to think that if we were faced with the same situation, we would stick to our beliefs. However, there's overwhelming evidence that humans are susceptible to bring influenced by others in ways we aren't always conscious of... 

Consider the lessons from the [Asch conformity experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asch_conformity_experiments), which was actually a series of experiments in which the psychologist Soloman Asch would put a single person in a group of people who believed that the others in the group were also participating in the research, when only one person's response was being examined. Asch would test to see that if the others in the group were to all report what was clearly the wrong answer, if the subject would go along with the others. 

!?[Asch Experiment - Conformity](https://youtu.be/6AUqTwGV3GQ?si=fQYsH69TYoDE5rLB)As we learn more about ethical frameworks and how to put them into practice in our own lives, they can serve as valuable tools for navigating the complexities of moral decision making. They help individuals and organizations make ethical choices that align with their values, principles, and societal expectations. Understanding these frameworks enhances moral reasoning and promotes ethical behavior in various personal, professional, and societal contexts.

Check Canvas for information about the next part of the ethical decision making case study we are exploring on our own and then with others in the class. That will contained within Challenge 03. 



## 04. Let's not get duped (or pass our ignorance onto others)

![Course lesson graphic 04](https://innovatelearning.s3.amazonaws.com/busn435-course-header-lesson-04.jpg)

It's not fun to look foolish. Yet it's easy to be tricked, given the state of where most of us get our information today: online.

I don't mean to sound offensive in saying the part about sounding ignorant. We're all ignorant about lots of stuff. You should try talking to me sometime about sports, for example, if you want to find someone ignorant on that broad set of subjects. 

The goal is to become more educated about the stuff that is important to us and to know when we don't know enough about something to be a credible source (or know how to spot a credible source). I also want you to be taken seriously in life. A big part of that comes down to being able to identify and communicate effectively about evidence that supports your assertions. 

**Meet a Mikey or maybe two?**

Consider the following (and notice if you can hear a voice associated with these words):

> He likes it. Hey, Mikey. 

If you say these words to someone around my age, they'll likely know exactly what you're talking about. However, since most of you (ok. All of you) are likely younger than me, here's what Mikey was famous for, back when I was a kid.

!?[Commercial for Life Cereal](https://youtu.be/CLQ0LZSnJFE?si=0r5RYZbAG_rtYFPD)

What ever happened to the guy who played Mikey in that commercial? They're sometimes known as urban legends. There was one about Mikey, back in the day. People would talk about how you never see him anymore. Where did Mikey go? Well, it turned out (or so people said) that he had died in the most tragic of ways. 

**It must have been the pop rocks.** 

People said it was some bad combination of pop rocks and Diet Coke. Or maybe just plain Coke? I may be getting my urban legends and actual science experiments (like the one with Mentos and Diet Coke, which really does work) confused. 

How would we have figured out if this was true back at that time? There wasn't an internet to go check. There were newspapers, limited by page and word counts and professional journalists and researcher assistants.

In order to help us be taken seriously and to navigate today's business news and media landscape, it's time to serve up the Starter Course from Mike Caulfield.

### 04.01 | Introduction to SIFT

Mike Caulfield is a prominent educator and digital literacy expert known for his work on a framework to help all of us be taken seriously and to be more literate in evaluating information we find online. He's best known for the SIFT model, which is featured in his "Check, Please! Starter Course," which we are about to embark on together. Mike Caulfield has a rich background in education, having worked at various institutions as an educator and researcher. He's known for his expertise in digital literacy and information literacy. Over the years, Caulfield has developed and refined the SIFT model, which is a practical framework for verifying and assessing online information. His work has been influential in equipping individuals with the skills to navigate the vast sea of information on the internet.

**The SIFT Model:**

The SIFT model is a systematic approach to evaluating online information for accuracy and reliability. It stands for:

1. **Stop:** This step encourages individuals to pause before sharing or believing information they encounter online. It emphasizes the importance of not immediately accepting or rejecting information.

2. **Investigate the Source:** In this step, Caulfield emphasizes the need to evaluate the credibility of the source of information. He provides techniques for determining whether a source is trustworthy or not.

3. **Find Better Coverage:** Caulfield suggests that individuals should look for multiple sources and perspectives on a topic to gain a more comprehensive understanding. This step helps students avoid falling into the trap of confirmation bias.

4. **Trace Claims, Quotes, and Media:** The SIFT model advises students to trace the claims made in a piece of information back to their original sources. This helps in uncovering potential misinterpretations or distortions.

5. **Check for Previous Work:** In this step, Caulfield recommends searching for existing fact-checks or investigations on the information in question. This can save time and provide additional context.

Mike Caulfield's Check, Please! Starter Course likely incorporates these principles of the SIFT model to teach business ethics students how to critically assess the information they encounter in the context of ethical decision-making. By following the SIFT model, we can develop essential skills for separating reliable information from misinformation (stuff we unintentionally misunderstand something and then share online) or disinformation (stuff nefarious people try to get us to believe by deceiving us or otherwise causing us harm).

Mike Caulfield has developed a great course to get us up and running with SIFT. I'm going to be making use of a lot what he has shared in his [Check, Please! Starter Course](https://checkpleasecc.notion.site/checkpleasecc/Check-Please-Starter-Course-ae34d043575e42828dc2964437ea4eed), which he has made available under a Creative Commons license[^1]. As long as I attribute what I share to Mike's work and point people back to his Check, Please! Starter Course, we're good (ethically and legally speaking). 

Throughout this lesson of the course, I will block off the sections written by and provided by Mike Caulfield, so you can tell it apart from what I'm sharing. Normally, this is how I quote other people, or make something stand out.

**Introduction to SIFT**

> This course will take you through the basics of quick source and claim-checking, and introduce you to our "four moves", a series of actions to take when encountering claims and sources on the web. 
>
> These course materials can be used for self-study, as part of a formal course, or as a set of independent assignments to practice your skills.
>
> The course is broken up into lessons, each of which can be completed in a single sitting. They take from 20 to 45 minutes, are composed of 5 to 15 pages, and include instruction and a series of exercises. While some exercises may seem repetitive, we recommend you complete them all, as the point is not just learning what fact-checking is, but building a fact-checking *habit*.
>
> The first lesson is a bit longer than the rest, and will introduce you to our basic approach — the "four moves" and the acronym we use to remember them: SIFT. The lesson will take 40 minutes to complete, including all readings, activities, and videos.

**Vocabulary: claims, sources**

- For the purpose of this course, a **claim** is a statement that purports to express something about reality. "The U.S. landed a space craft on the moon in 1969" is a relatively simple claim that is true. "The moon landing of 1969 was fake." is a simple claim that is false. "The mission to land on the moon was driven by Cold War fear more than scientific curiosity" is a complex claim one can have a range of opinions on, but is still, for a given context, either a well-supported claim, a controversial claim, or a claim lacking any real support.
- A **source** is the place where a claim or other information can be found. This course is a source of information about disinformation. Most claims can be found in multiple sources. You might find information about the moon landing in the Wall Street Journal, a website like Gizmodo, a textbook, a research paper, or a video recording of astronauts talking about the mission.

#### **Play Fakeout!** 

> Let's start this module with an activity designed by some folks at Civix Canada. Fakeout is an interactive lesson that tests your ability to detect "fake news" (we actually don't like that term, but more on that later).

![fakeout screenshot](https://checkpleasecc.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F248f9047-9d8d-41b8-b85f-b920f4b4aab6%2Ffakeout.png?table=block&id=f3cca8dd-265a-41a3-b41f-fb717f8c8c5b&spaceId=092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc&width=1370&userId=&cache=v2)

> Play Fakeout by [following this link](http://newsliteracy.ca/fakeOut). Play all the way through, and make sure to watch the videos in the middle. Come back here, once you're done. 


####  The problem with checklist approaches

> We've been doing research into why students fail to separate fact from fiction on the web.
>
> What we've found? Students are bad at the web because they've been taught techniques that make them bad at it. And they've learned those those bad techniques from *teachers*.
>
> Here's some things students often believe:
>
> - They believe that .org's are more trustworthy than .com's.
> - They believe that a good looking layout and few typos mean something is trustworthy.
> - They think pages that have ads on them are less trustworthy than those that don't.
> - They think that footnotes automatically make a site credible.
>
> These are only a few of the (very wrong) things students believe. Before you learn to read the web you may have to unlearn some of the stuff you've been taught.

**How CRAAP goes astray**

![A picture of the CRAAP method with 20+ questions.](https://checkpleasecc.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F0270152f-f0c3-421d-9e54-ae005ffa0f59%2Fcraap.jpg?table=block&id=70c03c84-53e4-48c9-8259-d7094c6876eb&spaceId=092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc&width=1400&userId=&cache=v2)

> Most instruction students get about reading the web is derived from a set of approaches called "checklist approaches".
>
> Sometimes these approaches were presented as literal checklists. Above is a checklist for a methodology called CRAAP. (I'm not joking).
>
> Sometimes they weren't checklists, but a set of "things to look for in a web page."

> What the approaches had in common was this: you'd come to a webpage and look for signals that the page was trustworthy on the *page itself*. You'd ask questions like
>
> - Does this look professional?
> - Are there spelling errors?
> - Is there scientific language?
> - Does it use footnotes?
> - The "checklist" idea? Students were told the more "good" things the page had the more "trustworthy" it was.
>
> Except there are three problems with this approach. Big problems.

**Problem 1: The signals are meaningless**

![Picture of Word document with autocorrect](https://checkpleasecc.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F6c2a4e96-7d12-4448-aeac-5297d6998faf%2Fspellcheck.jpg?table=block&id=36429352-6ca8-48b6-bf09-2f0e48305af8&spaceId=092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc&width=710&userId=&cache=v2))



> Most things people are told to look for? They're easy to fake. It's really cheap to get a good-looking site nowadays. You can be a disinformation agent from China or Russia and still use spell check. Anyone can add footnotes to make something look more serious (students do it all the time!) The same holds for using scientific language.
>
> And a lot of things students are told to look for have no basis in reality at all. In our research we have found students believe
>
> - .orgs are better than .coms (No.)
> - non-profits are better than for-profits (Wrong.)
> - less ads on a page means the page is more reliable (Not even close.)
>
> To put it simply — the things that might mean something are easy to fake, and many things students are taught to look for don't mean anything at all.

**Problem 2: The checklist processes take too long**

>Checklist processes were developed for students trying to decide which of a number of library resources to use for a paper. Given that time frame, such an approach might make sense. You can spend 20 minutes looking at each of three journal articles you found to see which would be the best fit for an end of term research project.
>
>In 2019, however, our problem is not deciding between three half-decent library resources over the course of an afternoon. Instead we are forced to sift through hundreds of possible search results and social media posts to try and determine whether each is worth our attention or belief.
>
>Take this TikTok video, for example. In it, one user has made a video that complains about the discontinuation of plastic straws out of what she sees as too high a level of concern about turtles. It's a bit meanly expressed, but that's her point. Another user posts a reaction — by 2050 there will be more plastic in the ocean than fish.

<iframe width="560px" height="800px" allowfullscreen="true" allow="autoplay *" title="duet with at beastmoder247 it is about more than just turtles savetheoceans" src="https://vanguard.instructuremedia.com/embed/a59c0eb3-77da-4741-90db-8b274b102b2b" frameborder="0"></iframe>

>It has literally taken me longer to explain this video than it takes you to watch it. But is the claim true? And what would happen if you had to engage in 20 minutes of investigation for every 10 second piece of content you viewed that made a claim?
>
>Actually, we know what happens when students are given in-depth techniques to deal with the flood of content that reaches them — they don't use them. Without quick methods people decide to share content like this based on whether it seems believable, or worse, they just decide they can't trust anything at all.
>
>The same is true with search. People use search to inform themselves about a variety of professional and civic issues. They search because they need to get information on a specific topic of pressing importance: how to safely change a tire, whether they should see a doctor about a rash, if the mayor's decision regarding panhandling will have a good or bad impact on the homelessness problem.
>
>But the biggest gap is not whether they research deeply. It's whether they check at all. Take that factoid about plastic and 2050. If you could reliably check it in 60 seconds, you might. If not, you're either going to reject it or accept it without checking — mostly unconsciously. Without quick methods to search and sift, your "knowledge" about an issue will slowly become a mental shoebox of unverified scraps you heard here and there around the web.
>
>While short methods may seem less rigorous, they are in fact better than long methods for many tasks. When I switch lanes while driving on the highway, I don't do a ten minute analysis of whether a car *might* be in the lane next to me. I check the mirror, do a head check, and change lanes. If my father had given me a ten minute lane-changing process when teaching me to drive, I wouldn't use it, and frequent accidents would just be a part of my life. This is the sort of thing you need for reading the web as well.

**Problem 3: Using too many criteria results in stupid decisions**

>One popular idea is that checklists are important because they force students to evaluate dozens of criteria instead of just a few. But does evaluating more criteria result in better decisions? Many teachers say yes. The research says no.
>
>The problem with having dozens of criteria is that many of them conflict. Readers then get overwhelmed, unsure to which ones they should pay the most attention.[^2] And that produces what I call the "sleazy car salesperson" effect.
>
>Maybe you've had the good fortune to never have to deal with a car dealership. But the way it usually goes is this. You go in to get a car and you just want automatic braking, a rear camera, and satellite radio. What happens? Well, they've got a car that has all three, but it's also the luxury sedan and it's $8,000 more. You do get seat warmers and remote start, which are worth x hundred dollars, and the new side collision detection that's at least $1,000 as an after-market addition. Or you can get this other car that has two features but not the third, and if you add on the aftermarket cost it's less expensive than the luxury car, but you don't get that side collision detection, etc., etc. And... well, it's exhausting even to read that, right?
>
>Car dealers set up cars this way intentionally, so that you can never weigh a couple factors in isolation, which leads to us being cognitively overwhelmed and making bad decisions. The effects of this sort of criteria overload are well-documented, going back decades. Yet methodologies like CRAAP set up processes in the same way.
>
>On a pre-assessment we give to students, for example, we have students evaluate a statistical claim about firearm background checks. The sort of response we see repeatedly is, "Well, it's a .org so it's likely to be trustworthy, but it has an ad on the page so maybe not." It's this is "car lot" cognition. There's a tidal wave of conflicting signals so in the end we throw up our hands and say, "Who can know?"

[^2]: Choices seem like such a good thing, in theory. However, as Mike Caulfield says in the in-depth section of this part of his SIFT course, "Many choices seems promising until you actually have to choose: UB research explains motivation fact..." He then links to [an article in Science Daily](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/06/190613153712.htm), which explains how: "People faced with more options than they can effectively consider want to make a good decision, but feel they're unable to do so, according to the results of a novel study. Despite the apparent opportunities presented by a lot of options, the need to choose creates a 'paralyzing paradox,' according to the authors. 'You want to make a good choice, but feel like you can't.'"

**Thank you, sir, may I have another**

We're back to Mike Caulfield's Check, Please! Starter Course and he's about to get to the main dish: SIFT. All these eating metaphors are making me hungry. 

#### Introducing SIFT

> So if long lists of things to think about only make things worse, how do we get better at sorting truth from fiction from everything in-between?
>
> Our solution is to give students and others a short list of things to do when looking at a source, and hook each of those things to one or two highly effective web techniques. We call the "things to do" moves and there are four of them:

![Infographic showing the steps of SIFT: Stop, investigate the source, find trusted coverage, trace claims, quotes and media to the original context.](https://checkpleasecc.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Fe3662e32-fba3-4ede-a0a1-3158cac5438b%2Fsift.png?table=block&id=a7a1f341-c590-4253-8f75-48453f8be726&spaceId=092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc&width=1400&userId=&cache=v2)

**Stop**

>The first move is the simplest. **STOP** reminds you of two things.
>
>First, when you first hit a page and start to read it — STOP. Ask yourself whether you know and trust the website or source of the information. If you don't, use the other moves to get a sense of what you're looking at. Don't read it or share it until you know what it is.
>
>Second, after you begin the process and use the moves it can be too easy to go down a rabbit hole, chasing after more and more obscure facts or getting lost in a "click cycle". If you feel yourself getting overwhelmed in your fact-checking efforts, STOP and take a second to remind yourself what your goal is. Adjust your strategy if it isn't working. Make sure you approach the problem at the right amount of depth for your purpose.

**Investigate the source**

> We'll go more into this move in the next lesson. The key idea is to know what you're reading *before* you read it.
>
> This doesn't mean you have to do a Pulitzer prize-winning investigation into a source before you engage with it. But if you're reading a piece on economics by a Nobel prize-winning economist, you should know that before you read it. Conversely, if you're watching a video on the many benefits of milk consumption that was put out by the dairy industry, you probably want to know that as well.
>
> This doesn't mean the Nobel economist will always be right and that the dairy industry can't ever be trusted. But knowing the expertise and agenda of the source is crucial to your interpretation of what they say. Taking sixty seconds to figure out where it is from *before* reading will help you decide if it is worth your time, and if it is, help you to better understand its significance and trustworthiness.

**Find trusted coverage** 

> Sometimes you don't care about the particular article that reaches you. You care about the claim the article is making. You want to know if it is true or false. You want to know if it represents a consensus viewpoint, or if it is the subject of much disagreement.
>
> In this case your best strategy is to ignore the source that reached you and look for other trusted reporting or analysis on the claim. In other words, if you receive an article that says koalas have just been declared extinct from the Save the Koalas Foundation, the winning strategy may be to open up a new tab and find the *best* source you can that covers this, or, just as importantly, scan multiple sources to see what the consensus seems to be. In these cases we encourage you to "find trusted coverage" that better suits your needs — more trusted, more in-depth, or maybe just more varied. We'll show you some techniques to do this sort of thing quickly.
>
> Do you have to agree with the consensus? Absolutely not! But understanding the context and history of a claim will help you better evaluate it.

**Trace claims, quotes, and media back to the original context**

> A lot of things you find on the internet have been stripped of context. Maybe there's a video of a fight between two people. But what happened before that? Who started it? What was clipped out of the video and what stayed in? Maybe there's a picture that seems real but the caption is dubious at best. Maybe a claim is made about a new medical treatment supposedly based on a research paper — but you're not certain if the paper supports it.
>
> In these cases we'll have you trace the claim, quote, or media back to the source, so you can see it in its original context and get a sense if the version you saw was accurately presented.

**It's about REcontextualizing**

> There's a theme that runs through all of these moves: it's about getting the necessary context to read, view, or listen effectively. And doing that *first*.
>
> One piece of context is who the speaker or publisher is. What's their expertise? What's their agenda? What's their record of fairness or accuracy? So we investigate the source. Just as when you hear a rumor you want to know who the source of it is before reacting to it, when you encounter something on the web you need the same sort of context.
>
> When it comes to claims, a key piece of context includes whether they are broadly accepted or rejected or something in-between. By scanning for other coverage you can see the expert consensus on a claim, learn the history around it, and ultimately land on a better source.
>
> Finally, when evidence is presented with a certain frame — whether a quote or a video or a scientific finding — sometimes it helps to reconstruct the original context in which the photo was taken or research claim made. It can look quite different in context!
>
> In some cases these techniques will show you claims are outright wrong, or that sources are legitimately "bad actors" who are trying to deceive you. But even when material is not intentionally deceptive, the moves do something just as important: they reestablish the context that the web so often strips away, allowing for more fruitful engagement with all digital information.


Vocabulary: bad actor, Pulitzer Prize

**It's time to get those feelings out**

You are being introduced to some skills that will be new for most of you. It may start to seem like a lot, so it is time to start capturing the learning in such a way as to be more memorable for you in the coming weeks and months. I've kept notes on SIFT and have even vlogged about my learning in a public way on my YouTube channel. 

#### Your Notebook

> Throughout this course you'll be asked both to do basic fact-checking activities and to think more deeply about the material presented. Here we introduce three things to help you with that.
>
> We ask that you keep a notebook of your fact-checking exercises in a text editor or a word processor like Notepad, Google Docs, or Microsoft Word. If you are taking this as part of a class, you will periodically be asked to submit the contents of your fact-checking notebook for feedback from [your professor and others in the class]. 
>
> The format of the notebook is simple. For each fact-checking assignment you will be given a heading. Write the heading in your document in all capital letters. Then hit enter and answer the questions you are asked to answer. Avoid any fancy formatting as you may have to post this in a format where the formatting will not carry over. 

At the very end of the course, you'll be asked to pick your favorite example from the notebook and to create a video, which will be shared with others in the class. Keeping links in your notebook will help save you time, later on, when you go to share your learning in a more public way.  

**Reflection prompts and vocabulary**

Reflection prompts are used to suggest questions for deeper exploration. Each time you see questions for reflection in the course, copy and paste them over to your notebook and prepare to discuss them either during a synchronous class, or asynchronously, through a video or written response. 

**Questions for reflection**

- Do you think media literacy could help some people avoid processes of radicalization? Or are the social drivers too strong?

- Are all conspiracy theories bad? Are all wrong? What do you think makes a conspiracy theory harmful? Do you hold beliefs that others would dismiss as conspiracy theory?
- Do you know anyone that has gone down the conspiracy rabbit hole on an issue? What have you learned from that experience about what drives conspiracy thinking?

[^1]: Mike Caulfield has asked that people using the [Check, Please! Starter Course](https://checkpleasecc.notion.site/checkpleasecc/Check-Please-Starter-Course-ae34d043575e42828dc2964437ea4eed) include the following note, so people know how to get back to the original: *The text and media of this site, where possible, is released into the CC BY, and free for reuse and revision. We ask people copying this course to leave this note intact, so that students and teachers can find their way back to the original (periodically updated) version if necessary. We also ask librarians and reporters to consider linking to the canonical version.*

**The Miseducation of Dylan Roof**

>Throughout this course, we'll be using a mixture of both weighty and trivial examples. Sometimes it may seem there's not much downside to being misinformed: who really cares if the "Alexa Voice-Activated Toilet" is real or Monster Brand Caffeinated Ham is fake?
>
>But there are serious social implications to people not paying attention to where their information is coming from.
>
>The video below primarily makes a point about Google. But given the facts presented here, is there a way that a lack of web literacy also played a role?

!?[Video: The miseducation of Dylann Roof](https://youtu.be/qB6A45tA6mE?si=Ids7nDj22uJwIMt1) 

> One of the patterns we see in online radicalization — from Nazism to ISIS — is that people often begin their journey by discovering information on the web from extremists that shocks them. Usually they are unaware — initially — of the source of the information, and if they were aware of the source they might be more skeptical of the information presented. By the time they understand who is supplying the information and what their motives are, they are already aligned with those organizations' viewpoints.
>
> Once a person starts down the conspiracy spiral, it's very hard to get back out. There is such a gap between what they see in "respected" sources and what they see from extremist sites that they come to believe the respected sites must be in on the conspiracy. And while in the past many people might hold one or two conspiracy theories, the hyper-connected, algorithmic nature of the internet creates a situation where believing in one conspiracy theory may lead to your exposure to more and more radical conspiracy theories.

**Questions for reflection**

- Do you think media literacy could help some people avoid processes of radicalization? Or are the social drivers too strong?
- Are all conspiracy theories bad? Are all wrong? What do you think makes a conspiracy theory harmful? Do you hold beliefs that others would dismiss as conspiracy theory?
- Do you know anyone that has gone down the conspiracy rabbit hole on an issue? What have you learned from that experience about what drives conspiracy thinking?


#### Conclusion

> In this 30 minute lesson you learned why some traditional approaches to online media literacy don't work, and were introduced to a new approach, encapsulated by the acronym SIFT. This approach favors "moves" rather than analysis, and encourages you to make quick checks before you read material.
>
> Now that we have the basics down we will start practicing some of the web techniques that you can use to get quick answers as you "sift".


### 04.02 | Investigate the Source

> One of the four "moves" is to "investigate the source". The following two short videos (less than four minutes) will introduce you to this move. As you'll see, we're not expecting people to do ground-breaking research, just to do some very quick checks.
>
> The first (3:15) video shows how many of the things we think will make us better at the web — raw intelligence, critical thinking skill, familiarity with technology — don't necessarily help:

!?[Online Verification Skills - Video 1: Introductory Video](https://youtu.be/yBU2sDlUbp8?si=cRd-fUMk4OAo-94e)

> The second video (2:45) introduces you to our second move: investigate the source. (In case you forgot the first move already, the first move is "Stop")

!?[Online Verification Skills - Video 2: Investigate the Source](https://youtu.be/hB6qjIxKltA?si=eaHlQfCG357nlbj9)


#### Just add Wikipedia

> On the previous page you watched a video demonstrating the "Just add Wikipedia" technique. In that case we opened a new tab and fired up a search result page, typing a domain plus "Wikipedia" into the search box. In this next video, we show a variation of that technique that you can do in the omnibar of your browser (that part of the browser in which you can type a web location or a search phrase). We also show how this is particularly helpful for quick research on organizations.

!?[Just add Wikipedia (Source Verification Omnibar Hack)](https://youtu.be/oBqEci8eXXA?si=sToxcnuhc3lH8sN2)

> Notice that while the most relevant Wikipedia article usually floats to the top of results, this is not always true. In the case of researching Nuclear Matters, the most informative Wikipedia page was the second result. When looking at *Before It's News* the first Wikipedia result that came up was the right one — but it was second in the Google results, after a result from Rational Wiki.

**Use Surprise as an Indicator**

> What do you look for on the Wikipedia page? It varies. Sometimes — as with the Nuclear Matters material in the video above — what sticks out most is the agenda of the group, e.g. something you thought was a research group turns out to be a political advocacy group with ties to the industry. Sometimes it's the fact that a source has a history of unreliability, as was the case with *Before It's News*. And many times (most, actually!) it will turn out the source just fine, as we saw above with the *SacBee* example.
>
> But rather than a checklist of things to look for on the Wikipedia page, I want you to focus on two organizing questions:
>
> - Is the site or organization I am researching what I thought it was?
> - If not, does it make it more or less trustworthy?
>
> If you thought something was from a straight news site and it turns out to be from a conspiracy site, that should surprise you. And given your new knowledge, your initial impression of the trustworthiness should plummet. If you thought you were looking at a minor, unknown newspaper and it turns out to be a multi-award winning national newspaper of record, maybe your assessment of its trustworthiness increases. The effects on trust are of course contextual as well: a small local paper may be a great source for local news, but a lousy source for health advice or international politics.

**Vocabulary: paper of record**

A national paper of record is a reputable paper that attempts to cover all important national news with staff reporters. They are distinguished from regional and local papers which use staff primarily for local or regional news.

#### What's Important Depends On Context

> What you take note of when doing investigate the source searches will be highly dependent on how you initially interpreted the source.
>
> As an example, I remember looking at a comment on Twitter from what I thought was an internet rando. He was talking about a historical point with a lot of confidence. I thought it was an interesting point, but not worthy of my attention. Out of habit I did a Wikipedia check on his name and found that he was a world renowned historian who had written the most popular textbook on the subject at hand. Surprise! I went back and read his comment more carefully and thought about it more deeply.
>
> Conversely, I've occasionally seen newspapers on the web that seem to me (in the names and the way they look) like old established papers. Throwing their name into a *just add Wikipedia* search I find they don't have a Wikipedia page (odd if the paper is supposed to be a major paper) or that they were established less than two years ago. Neither of those outcomes means the paper is not to be trusted, but it might change the way I read it or prompt me to do more research.
>
> Note that there can't be any hard and fast rule here — there's not a list of rules that says writing a textbook on the subject is good, not having a Wikipedia page is bad. But a lot of this is obvious in the specific case.
>
> One caveat — some students, used to just reacting to claims, may not be forming conscious opinions of what a source is. If this is the case with you, take just the smallest fraction of a second to think about what you think you are looking at before you research it. Do you think this is a major news source? A local paper? A government database? A grassroots, people-powered movement? A professional organization? As we go through the course we'll talk more about some of these categories of sources.

**Vocabulary: grassroots, professional organization**

- **Grassroots organizations** are organizations which are primarily run and funded by interested citizens and independent activists.
- **Professional organizations** provide an array of services and support to people in a given field. An organization for electrical engineer may provide professional standards to follow, research on best practices, training for members, and lobbying for the field.

**SIFTing: Alexa-enabled toilet? (prompt)**

> Each of our "Sifting" exercises will give you a scenario, show you a prompt associated with it, and ask you a question associated with it. You should "use your moves" on the prompt (the components of SIFT), then write your results in your notebook. If you are a student in a class, when you write your results in your notebook, make sure to use the specified heading, so that your teacher knows what prompt you are responding to.
>
> We start the course with some pretty light exercises. So here's your first exercise. A friend sends you a text about a new "Alexa Toilet":

![SMS message with text "Great, now there's an Alexa microphone in the bathroom too"](https://checkpleasecc.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Fdb279215-906a-498a-93fd-66c73d6687f7%2Ftoilet1.png?table=block&id=c5108c12-f468-4dc4-92d6-4557aed780ee&spaceId=092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc&width=690&userId=&cache=v2)

Visit the [story on Tom's Guide about the Kohler Alexa toilet](https://www.tomsguide.com/us/kohler-numi-alexa-toilet,news-28957.html) and perform the activity described below: 

> Now we could use our "Find Trusted Coverage" move here. But let's hold off on that. The question I want you to investigate is:
>
> - Is Tom's Guide a known product review site or something else?
>
> Use the **Investigate the Source** move, find out what you can. In your notebook, write the heading ALEXA TOILET, hit enter and tell us what you found out.
>
> When you are done, go to the next part to see how a fact-checker might approach this problem.

**SIFTing: Alexa toilet (discussion)**

> Here's an example of what a fact-checker might say:
>
> **ALEXA TOILET**
>
> According to Wikipedia, Tom's Guide is a publication run by the people who run Tom's Hardware, a very old and well known product review site. You can find this in the Wikipedia article on Tom's Hardware in the Related Publications section, and if you want to be super sure, click the linked footnote that talks more about the site and confirms this is the right URL for it. It seems like a trusted source for this kind of news.
>
> How did we find that out? We used the Just add Wikipedia trick:

![GIF showing someone typing tomsguide.com wikipedia into their web browser and viewing some info about Tom's Hardware](https://file.notion.so/f/f/092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc/2223113f-0fa8-408f-a663-64083a1f9524/toms-guide1.gif?id=2f5f9113-2049-44b4-9d7e-16876465d7f5&table=block&spaceId=092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc&expirationTimestamp=1704427200000&signature=D9s0HdWATVlflwgOAGti86EnPnxr87CBmqe3B374F_U)

> We searched for the site (adding our bare keyword "wikipedia"), and found the most relevant Wikipedia page at the top of the results. It wasn't an exact match, but it was close enough to check it out.
>
> Clicking through to the Wikipedia article Tom's Hardware, we searched (using either control or command-f) for the phrase Tom's Guide on the page, and found it in Related Publications.
>
> This is probably enough to state it's a legitimate site for this sort of story, but if we wanted to be extra sure that the Tom's Guide mentioned here is tomsguide.com, there is a footnote on that part of the Wikipedia page, and if we follow it we find this:
>
> **Los Angeles - September 18, 2007 - TG Publishing LLC (www.tgpublishing.net) a Bestofmedia Group company, one of the top-three online media publishing companies for technology in the world, announced today the rebrand of Gear Digest to Tom's Guide (www.tomsguide.com). Tom's Guide is the definitive online resource for unbiased and trusted information on the latest consumer electronics and technology gear.**
>
> That's a press release from the group that runs Tom's Guide, so it might not be a great resource for some things, but for the purpose of confirming the URL is a match it's perfect. Less than sixty seconds of effort and we know this is a real site and likely a real story. Share the Alexa toilet story with anybody you desire.
>
> Take a look at the answer in your notes. How did you do in your investigation? If you want to touch up your answer having read this, go ahead. 
>
> Although not shown in the animation, we used "control-f" to search for information on the web page. If you are familiar with control-f (command-f on a Mac) continue on with the lesson. But if not, [watch this video on how to find a word on a web page with control-F](https://youtu.be/D-FkKwRD4iY?si=8aq3kaUsf8D0hj5n) and [check out this article on using control-f on the web](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/08/crazy-90-percent-of-people-dont-know-how-to-use-ctrl-f/243840/) — we'll be using it a lot.


#### Wikipedia

> Wikipedia is broadly misunderstood by faculty and students alike. While Wikipedia must be approached with caution, especially with articles that are covering contentious subjects or evolving events, it is often the best source to get a consensus viewpoint on a subject. Because the Wikipedia community has strict rules about sourcing facts to reliable sources, and because authors must adopt a neutral point of view, its articles are often the best available introduction to a subject on the web.
>
> The focus on sourcing all claims has another beneficial effect. If you can find a claim expressed in a Wikipedia article, you can almost always follow the footnote on the claim to a reliable source. Scholars, reporters, and students can all benefit from using Wikipedia to quickly find authoritative sources for claims.
>

**Aligator (prompt)**

Check out both of these news reports and answer the questions below.

[https://abcnews4.com/news/local/granddaughter-of-90-ye...](https://abcnews4.com/news/local/granddaughter-of-90-year-old-woman-killed-by-alligator-sues-west-ashley-nursing-home)

https://kdvr.com/2016/07/29/90-year-old-woman-killed-by-alligator-at-south-carolina-nursing-home/

**Questions**

- Are these trustworthy news sources for this sort of story?
- Is this story likely true?
- If you had to pick the best source of the two based just on what you found on Wikipedia, which one would you pick, and why?

**Alligator (discussion)**

> Here's one possible response:
>
> Both these sources are real news sources according to Wikipedia. The alligator story is real. If I had to pick one of the two I would pick the first TV station (abcnews4) in this case because they are more local to the event (they are in Charleston, the city where it happened) vs. the KDVR story which seems to just be reprinting someone else's story (and is in Denver, not South Carolina!)
>
> How do we get there? We start by doing our "just add wikipedia" trick. Let's show the ABC one first:

![GIF showing the ABC add wikipedia trick](https://file.notion.so/f/f/092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc/3b72c03d-534a-4d73-bae9-ef2f542dad1d/alligator-abc1.gif?id=f5e706fd-d26f-4d7d-ab47-aa0a4d83807a&table=block&spaceId=092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc&expirationTimestamp=1704427200000&signature=h4rWparGuJCKsDZ-KEbzAfIY0inpVvKMw4js3kAnD2w)

> We search the URL or domain and add our bare keyword "wikipedia". Selecting the most relevant search result we find it is about a local TV station in Charleston. Just to be sure the article is for the right site, we scroll down and make sure the URL matches. It does!
>
> What about KDVR?

![GIF of typing https://KDVR.com wikipedia into Google browser search](https://file.notion.so/f/f/092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc/83fdb898-ac56-427f-ba6f-5ad716eb2d01/kdvr.gif?id=3d62d56f-baf0-4dbb-b0cb-8e004ed46a15&table=block&spaceId=092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc&expirationTimestamp=1704427200000&signature=6uUWVOpF8DGrB6UtisBYWYr3Ngap0YZ2BLXKra7ffzw)

#### When are local sources good?

> Here's our first reflection: we often talk about authority being "contextual and constructed." Let's take that "contextual" piece. An organization that might have authority in one area, but won't have the same level of authority in all areas. For example, a fitness instructor might be a great person for advice on a fitness routine, but you wouldn't get medical advice from them. Likewise, you might ask your doctor about an illness or medical condition, but you wouldn't expect them to be an expert in aerobics.
>
> Local and national newspapers employ reporters that have very similar skills, much more similar than fitness instructors and doctors. But even here authority differs depending on the type of story. For your first reflection, think of a sort of story where a local paper would have a high degree of authority. Then think of another sort of story where they might have far less authority.

**Questions for reflection**

- For what sort of other stories might a local source be a particularly good authority?
- For what sort of other stories might a local source not be a good authority?

**Volcano plane (prompt)**

> Take a look at this story and answer the questions.

[Malaysia Airline flight forced into emergency landing](https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/malaysia-airline-flight-forced-into-emergency-landing-after-flying-over-icelandic-volcano/)

**Questions**

- What sort of source is this?
- How do you know?

**Volcano plane (discussion)**

> Here's one possible response:
>
> **World News Daily report is a satire site that by its own admission does not publish true stories. It's is also the source or a lot of hateful content. I found this out from Wikipedia — the Wikipedia article cited a large range of sources, from Buzzfeed to the Washington Post.**
>
> How do we get there? We start by doing our "just add wikipedia" trick. Let's show the ABC one first:

![Search the URL and add Wikipedia](https://file.notion.so/f/f/092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc/cf2ec0a4-6114-44e1-9664-56b4ef5ce498/volcano1.gif?id=97f137ee-3a02-40ba-b640-6b41a97061bf&table=block&spaceId=092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc&expirationTimestamp=1704427200000&signature=28vk_1iqJnQSMCaEYJLLwbf7Ffxf1THOoGn1lVFUMuo)

> We search the URL or domain and add our bare keyword `wikipedia`. Selecting the most relevant search result we find it is a known satire site.

**A note about Buzzfeed**

> One thing you'll notice in the Wikipedia article is that Buzzfeed News is cited as source. Students are often confused by this, since they are most used to Buzzfeed being primarily a source of videos such as "I tried to eat five popular candies from Romania and this is what happened."
>
> That Buzzfeed site isn't good news source for very much. It's not "fake", but it's not very serious. Years ago, however, Buzzfeed spun off a reliable, award winning news publication under the name "Buzzfeed News" (domain: www.buzzfeednews.com). And harkening back to our "contextual authority" discussion earlier, it turns out that Buzzfeed News has two of the top experts in the world on the "fake news" phenomenon. So when you see a link to Buzzfeed News on question about the trustworthiness of a site, it's well worth following.

#### The Problem of Fauxtire

> One problem — larger in the past, but still extant — is the problem of "fauxtire". Experts on disinformation use the term fauxtire to describe sites such as World News Daily Report which claimed to be satire sites (like the Onion) but in practice were not linked to because people thought they were funny but because people were fooled into thinking the stories were real.
>
> This presents an interesting problem — if you run a site that is supposedly a humor site, but in practice it is convincing people of awful things, are you responsible for that? What if you intentionally tweak satirical headlines so they are more likely to deceive people (and hence make you more money from ads)?

**Questions for Reflection**

- What are your feelings on fauxtire? Is it an ethical practice?
- Should companies like Facebook and Twitter downrank articles if they are being spread based on the impression they are "real" when they are not? What are the dangers of that?


#### Conclusion

> You finished lesson two! In the past thirty minutes, you've learned about one "move" (investigate the source) and one web technique associated with it ("just add wikipedia").
>
> Next up we'll apply what you learned about investigating the source to a couple specific issues.

### 04.03 | Further Investigation

> Let's put our investigate the source (the "I" in SIFT) move to use. We'll look into the problem of state-controlled media, and show you a variation of the "just add wikipedia" technique that you can use for individuals and organizations without websites.
>
> Ready to get started?

**MH17 (prompt)**

> For this exercise, you'll need a bit of background. MH17 was a passenger plane shot down by Ukrainian separatists. Take one minute to watch this short video on the history of the crash.

!?[Video: Investigation finds MH17 was hit by a Russian-made missile](https://youtu.be/74BmEkgNRNY?si=mET-cJzi-ZAfZj0G)

> Looking only at issues around the source (and not the article itself), which of the following publishers is a better source on the downing of MH17 and why?

1. [Russians, Ukrainian to face murder charges over downing of Flight MH17]((https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-mh17/russians-ukrainian-to-face-murder-charges-over-downing-of-flight-mh17-idUSKCN1TJ30G/))

2. [Video: Error message, video is not available in your country](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEvUHfjS3Ig)

Spoiler alert. When Mike designed this exercise, that second video was available. However, since then, when trying to access the video, we get an error message saying that the video is not available in our country. You're probably guessing (correctly) that the first source (Reuters) is a better source to learn more about the downing of MH17 than Russian tv would have been. 

Pronunciation guide: 

?[How to say Reuters]((https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/transcoded/1/18/Reuters_%28spoken_word%29.ogg/Reuters_%28spoken_word%29.ogg.mp3))

If we really wanted to see the video, we could make use of the Internet Wayback Machine, but for now, I think it's ok to skip that extra step. Since you couldn't view the video, in all likelihood, just head over to Wikipedia and see what it has to share with us about RT.com. 

[RT (TV Network)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RT_(TV_network))

You will learn more about the specifics related to the MH17 flight in the next section (discussion). 

**MH17 (discussion)**

> You probably noticed in the initial video evidence strongly suggests elements of the Russian government were involved with the downing of the flight, though the targeting of the passenger plane was likely a mistake.
>
> Given this, it would be odd to trust RT on the issue, since the Wikipedia article on RT shows that RT (formerly *Russia Today*) is seen by many to be a propaganda tool of the Russian government.
>
> How did we find that information? We started by doing our "just add wikipedia" trick. Let's show the Reuters one first:

![GIF showing the "just add wikipedia" moves in checking out Reuters.com](https://file.notion.so/f/f/092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc/6376aecc-e95c-406c-986b-7be1faea6ffa/reuters-mh17.gif?id=dfcfaf5d-90cc-4a34-b392-3df109b312ae&table=block&spaceId=092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc&expirationTimestamp=1704477600000&signature=wkTiWazsszOeORa1VVg8pwyxnTR0GVhYJVis2Gdos4Q)

> We search the URL or domain and add our bare keyword "wikipedia". Selecting the most relevant search result, we find Reuters is an international news organization. Scanning the article we note that there have been a few controversies related to timidity with climate change reporting and allegations of anti-Israel bias, but nothing that relates to this subject.
>
> What about RT?

![An animated GIF showing the 'just add Wikipedia' moves in checking out rt.com](https://file.notion.so/f/f/092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc/74f18012-7723-4ed2-86e1-5d30f5c3d79f/rt-mh17.gif?id=281d2872-4ce2-4e22-8dce-1693671e6afd&table=block&spaceId=092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc&expirationTimestamp=1704477600000&signature=eJrufsauirHQJw0A3FKhu5NEgaoQ8VuX0KnkHHXUtLg)

> We do the same search for the URL or domain adding our bare keyword "wikipedia". As mentioned above, when we click through to the article we notice it is funded by the Russian government. Government funding is not necessarily bad, but scroll further we note that there are credible accusations it is a government propaganda outlet. In this case, read Reuters, a credible international news agency, and ditch RT.

#### Controversies on Wikipedia Pages

> One of the more difficult things for students is evaluating controversies on Wikipedia pages. Almost any paper of significant size and history will have controversies. So what counts? When scanning controversies quickly, it's worthwhile to look for a couple things.
>
> First, is there evidence of outright deception or the embracing of conspiracy theories? Direct government influence? An agenda that is explicitly focused on propaganda? Things that are intentional or patterns of behavior mean more than ocassional error.
>
> Second, if errors are noted are they related to the topic you are looking at? A paper that has published sloppy reporting on health claims, for example, might be okay on political news. And papers with biased opinion columns are often home to quality reporting. But if you are looking at a health claim and the controversies are around health, that may be a different story.
>
> As always, stop and be strategic about your research — the question is usually whether a particular source good enough, or if there are enough questions around it that you should find better coverage. You don't have to prove RT lied about MH17, for example. 
>
> **You just have to read enough of the Wikipedia page to realize you shouldn't be reading coverage from state-controlled media on this issue, especially since the state in question was likely involved in the event.**

#### Government manipulation of online media

> Russia is not alone in using influence to spread disinformation — many countries pursue such actions internally, and a number, like Russia and Iran, attempt to sow discord in other nations. Read the following (very short) article on state sponsored influence operations:

The original link that Mike had in his course is no longer available. Again, if crucial to our research, we could use the Internet Wayback Machine to locate it. However, in searching the present-day internet to find it, I did locate this related article that may help us discover more about why YouTube (which is owned by Google) would have blocked that last YouTube video from Mike's mini course.

[Facebook, Google and Twitter limit ads over Russia's invasion of Ukraine, by Shannon Bond](https://www.npr.org/2022/02/26/1083291122/russia-ukraine-facebook-google-youtube-twitter)

**Questions for reflection**

- What obligations do American companies have to prevent this sort of use of their platforms? 
- What responsibilities belong with the reader instead?

#### Expertise and reputation

> Evaluating expertise is hard. And we're not going to show you how to do that in any fine grained way.
>
> But we will show you how to sanity-check expertise, to see if they are known to have expertise in their area or more pseudo than science, more salesperson than professional.

!?[Video: Mike Caulfield presents about expertise](https://youtu.be/yU9JELSQGfU)

> The first example uses our "Just add Wikipedia" trick.  In the second example we show we used:
>
> - Google News Search https://www.google.com/search?tbm=nws&source=hp&q=news+query+here&oq=
> - Google Scholar: https://scholar.google.com/

**Warming claims (prompt)**

> Here's an article by a guest author, Myles Allen, arguing that climate change is incredibly serious but that the way some activists are talking about the recent IPCC report (considered to be the scientific consensus on global warming) is at times alarmist. We are going down a very dangerous road if we don't act on climate change now, Allen agrees, but he also says the idea that most people will feel world-ending impacts in twelve years is not supported.

[The problem with claiming we have '12 years to climate breakdown, by Myles Allen in RealClear Science'](https://www.realclearscience.com/articles/2019/04/24/the_problem_with_claiming_we_have_12_years_to_climate_breakdown.html)

> In this case, since Allen is not a reporter but instead presented as an expert. Check out his expertise by doing a Wikipedia search on his name. You'll have to use a bit of creativity here — but replace the domain name you've been searching on with his name.
>
> Is he well qualified to write this article? Why or why not?
>
> (Again, remember it's not about whether you think he is right or wrong here. We just want to know if his opinion here is worth considering and why.)

**Warming claims (discussion)**

> We check for Myles Allen in Wikipedia with the search `myles allen wikipedia`. There's a substantial chance he won't be in Wikipedia even if he *is* an expert, but it's a good first step to check there.
>
> In this case, we luck out! He's in there:

![Animated GIF showing wikipedia search results for Myles Allen](https://file.notion.so/f/f/092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc/02d63bc8-b10d-4833-85dd-e8808c6a9b9e/myles.gif?id=5831a803-1219-4605-9bf4-5ff77fc010e5&table=block&spaceId=092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc&expirationTimestamp=1704477600000&signature=srrIfNk3ZW876gcywvnEwpltKBuk3oQiuvHhkBob65o)

> Look at the Wikipedia article and then look (skim, really) his opinion piece. Does he have relevant expertise? Double check the answer in your fact-checking notebook and write down your assessment of the writer's expertise.

Questions for reflection
- One of the understandings key to media literacy is "authority is constructed and contextual".  Different communities (scientists, reporters, politicians, psychologists, car mechanics) have different criteria for authority (constructed) and the type and level of authority you need may depend on your context (contextual).  What other types of expertise could this issue benefit from?

**Smoke-free (prompt)**

> Here's a summary of a report from an organization called Foundation for a Smoke-Free World. They want to eliminate smoking worldwide.

[Global Trends in Nicotine]((https://www.smokefreeworld.org/advancing-industry-transformation/global-trends-nicotine/))

> For this example, do a Google News search on the foundation name. Is there anything in particular we should know about this organization before reading their materials? Describe what you found out and what sources you used in your fact-checking notebook. Use the heading SMOKE-FREE.

**Smoke-free (discussion)**

> In this case we use a Google News Search. There's multiple results, but we scan the little "keyword in context" blurbs to find relevant coverage.

![GIF showing the search for Foundation for a Smoke-Free World](https://file.notion.so/f/f/092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc/4310bbd7-b18c-45a7-83bf-42747867c450/smokefreeworld.gif?id=e140a218-9f54-43b2-b9a7-3047ba5d0b66&table=block&spaceId=092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc&expirationTimestamp=1704477600000&signature=F6KsToi4ibmBTLrrYnFQsMDWxWST2RVrCM7XP5YmBEY)

> We choose the source PRWatch. PRWatch isn't a perfect source — they've been accused at times of having an anti-corporate bias — but in general their reporting is well-sourced.
>
> When we go to that article (or many of the other articles on that page) we find that there is some debate about whether the tobacco-industry funded Foundation for a Smoke-Free World should be seen as a research and advocacy organization. Part of that debate centers around its initial funding (it was founded with a large grant from the tobacco industry). But the critique of it from researchers is more subtle than that — they point out that the proportion of money spent on marketing to that spent on research is not indicative of a research organization. And you can see that some of those researchers [wrote that in a letter](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(19)31347-9/fulltext#%20) to one of the more prestigious English-language health journals, the *Lancet*.
>
> Even given all this, you might come to a conclusion that this organization is trustworthy, at least in some limited contexts. Or maybe not. But either way, it's crucial to know about the debate about this organization before you engage with (or share) its materials.

**Bias vs. Agenda**

> The above issue gets at an important distinction when looking at sources. Students often come to media literacy thinking that the primary thing they should be concerned about is bias. And since everyone has some form of bias, that ultimately leads to students thinking no one can really be trusted.
>
> Personal bias has real impacts. But bias isn’t agenda, and it's agenda that should be your primary concern for quick checks.
>
> Bias is about how people see things; agenda is about what a news or research organization is set up to *do*. A site that clearly marks opinion columns as opinion, employs dozens of fact-checkers, hires professional reporters, and takes care to be transparent about sources, methods, and conflicts of interest is less likely to be driven by political agenda than a site that does not do these things. And this holds true even if the reporters themselves may have personal bias. Good process and good culture goes a long way to mitigating personal bias.
>
> You saw this in the introductory videos on the American College of Pediatricians. The main issue was not that the organization was biased, or even that was small (though this mattered somewhat). The main issue was that it didn't seem to be set up as a research or professional organization. It seemed, in fact, to be set up as a political advocacy organization.
>
> Similarly, in this instance even though the tobacco industry has a long history of deception the researchers are not ruling out that it might be funding some good work. It's possible, even if suspicious.
>
> What they are alleging is that the structure of the organization resembles a marketing organization more than a research organization, and that as such its research should be looked upon with some suspicion.
>
> Again, you need to come to your own conclusion on whether that assessment is damning. But whether you agree with the researchers or not, adopt their approach. Ask first and foremost when approaching an organization or source "What is this group set up to do?"

#### Conclusion

> You finished lesson three! In the past thirty minutes, you've expanded your knowledge of how to investigate sources. Three new techniques were introduced:
>
> - "Just add wikipedia", but for names and organizations
> - Google Scholar searches for verifying expertise
> - Google News searches for information about organizations and individuals
>
> Additionally, you learned
>
> - What state media is, and how to identify it
> - The difference between bias and agenda, and why it matters

### 04.04 | Find Trusted Coverage

> We've covered:
>
> (S)top!
>
> (I)nvestigate the source
>
> And now we get to F: Find trusted coverage.
>
> Sometimes when you investigate the source you'll find that the source is sufficient for your needs. We saw, for instance, an article on global warming written by a person that was an expert on the impact of climate change, and even though their point — that some activists were exaggerating climate impacts — was annoying to some on both the left and the right, we saw the opinion and analysis worthy of our attention.
>
> Sometimes we can't determine the reliability of the source. And most of the time we don't really care about the source at all. We just want to get an accurate story on the subject from somewhere.
> When the initial source you encounter is low quality and you just care about the claim your best strategy might be to find a better source altogether. We're going to show you how to do that in this lesson.
>
> But first a story about Keanu Reeves.

**Quick checks for other reporting: Keanu Reeves**

> Celebrity death hoaxes happen from time to time — in fact, one of the first big viral pieces of web fakery was a 2001 report that Britney Spears had died in a car crash. So when we see news that a celebrity has died, it's good to be cautious.
>
> On the other hand, we're not monsters. If someone did actually die — whether Prince or Tom Petty or a favorite YouTube star — we'd like to express our emotions about it. We'd like to share the news with others. It's emotional, and we don't want to treat it like a research project. Luckily, it really isn't hard to see if something is a death hoax or not. Just check trusted coverage.
>
> How do you do this? Well, consider this report that "Keanu Reeves is dead."

![Image of a headline saying that Keanu Reeves has died in a snowboard accident](https://checkpleasecc.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F32c8aa2a-6fed-44c7-8dba-d0dcf91d3bfe%2Fkeanu-reeves-died-in-snowboard-accident.jpg?table=block&id=1ab6281c-abd9-4d27-8331-d43bff53bd64&spaceId=092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc&width=1080&userId=&cache=v2)

> Is it true? If it was, we'd expect there to be lots of news stories about it. So we check.

> What do we find? The top stories about Keanu Reeves are about him making a surprise stop to sign a fan's yard sign. Doesn't sound very dead! Just to be sure, we search for `Keanu Reeves dead` and the only thing that comes up are stories about how a video game with "Death" in the title almost featured Reeves.
>
> Conclusion: Keanu Reeves is not dead.

**Most big stories get covered by multiple outlets**

> What does it look like when some one actually *has* died? This is a bit morbid, but the morning I am writing this MMA boxer Maxim Dadashev passed away due to injuries sustained in a fight. He was a minor figure you've probably not heard of, and yet when we search `Maxim Dadashev dead` in Google News search we find there are already multiple stories confirming this.

> We click through to the USA Today story here, but we really didn't need to. Just seeing this many results on the news page is good enough for us to believe a claim of this sort. Go ahead and share this story, comment on it, and feel what emotions you have to.

**Questions for reflection**

- Why did we search for Keanu Reeves instead of Keanu Reeves snowboard?
- Why do you think so many otherwise smart people make errors when it comes to death hoaxes? What are the emotional drivers? What are the social incentives that push people not to check?

**Using fact-checks from news search: Chik-Fil-A**

Once I get a song in my head, I often have it floating around in there for quite some time. As soon as I saw Chik-Fil-A in this headline, I just had to share this one. It's such a good song, and maybe you've been sitting a while and need to take a quick mental break.  

!?[Louis Jordan Ain't Nobody Here But Us Chickens 1956](https://youtu.be/HnyB0a8G71Y?si=wdkH4kmxxp62vq6M)

Ok. We had better get back, right? Back to Mike Caulfield, gettin' us SIFTing along... 

> In our Keanu Reeves example, the absence of any news stories was telling. But many times when you use Google News (or other news search) you'll find something better: a fact-check on the claim.
>
> Let's take a story circulating as I write this, one claiming a Georgia lawmaker believed she was told by a Chik-Fil-A employee to "go back to her country" but later clarified that she was mistaken.

![Headline: Georgia lawmaker claims Chick-Fil-A employee told her to go back to her country, later clarifies he actually said 'my pleasure'](https://checkpleasecc.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F3cd210fb-17c1-4d9b-b6de-52d849b51b41%2Fbabylon-bee.webp?table=block&id=7276d21f-889c-4bab-8c88-30bfd52c6dcc&spaceId=092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc&width=1400&userId=&cache=v2)

> In this case we do the news search, and we do find something: a fact-check by Snopes:

![GIF of Google search for Chick-Fil-A Georgia county](https://file.notion.so/f/f/092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc/e2ef7116-44ce-42a8-8849-7586de0c0048/chik-fil-a-lawmaker.gif?id=7c8a2c17-5b67-4a5d-b5ad-8dc3433108d2&table=block&spaceId=092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc&expirationTimestamp=1704477600000&signature=OPycIXSHPgP30eLIIWrMbW1cOKgn3XWK_1qboiyoCY8)



> The Snopes fact-check labels this as false, but more importantly it presents the background in detail: a similar incident happened at another store sometime earlier, but the *Babylon Bee* is a satirical publication that created a very similar (but false) story.
>
> Snopes initially gave this story a "false" rating, but many objected, claiming that the site did not attempt to hide it was satire, and labeling satirical articles as false was unfair (and a bit humorless!). Snopes made a counterargument that *Babylon Bee* articles were repeatedly shared by readers as true, due to a deceptive way the *Bee* constructs articles (a practice sometimes called fauxtire). Eventually Snopes relented and introduced a new ruling: "labelled satire."
>
> So was Snopes right in the initial ruling? Wrong? Somewhere in between? Was this a case of semi-intentional deception, or just satire not funny enough for people to recognize as satire? 
>
> Here's the thing: people can get twisted in knots over the ruling, and both sides can go into outrage over the unfairness of it all, but for you as a fact-checker the ruling doesn't matter so much. It's the fact-checking article that is most valuable to you. 
>
> Fact-checks are useful to web readers because they are designed to give a concise explanation of particular claims and because good fact checks (like good Wikipedia articles) show their work by linking to high quality sources that you can look at yourself. The ruling is helpful, but isn't what matters most: it's the explanation and all the links they've compiled for you. If you doubt this ruling, you can click to the site itself and see that both sides have a point, the *Babylon Bee* bills themselves as a satirical publication, although, as Snopes initially noted, this is not made as clear as it might be.



**Questions for Reflection**

- The *Babylon Bee* has been criticized by many for repeatedly writing satire that is not notably satirical enough for people to recognize it as a joke. Critics say that this is reckless, as most people will develop false impressions from reading the headlines that float past on Facebook. What are your thoughts on this? Some links on this issue are included at the bottom of the page.

- If people are sharing a story as if it is true, it makes sense for Snopes to fact-check it. But is "False" the correct rating for satire or fauxtire? Look at the [ratings Snopes uses](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check-ratings/) and develop two arguments: one argument that Snopes should introduce a new category of "satire", and one argument that it should not.

- Even if you disagree with the rating of false, does the Snopes article give you enough information to make up your own mind?

#### Scanning Results Using "Click Restraint"

> Some times a search on a claim will turn up multiple stories, many of which are not relevant. Consider this bit of viral news that circulated on Facebook:
>
> **You know when you go to Walmart and they have the wipes to clean your cart handle? How many of you don’t use them? Well I do, and I always thought of the germs only. Was told today that the police chief also suggests you do it also because of all the problems with drugs now days, and if they have fentanyl or something like that still on their hands and they touch that cart handle and then you do, it can get into your system. Scary but worth taking the time to clean the handle. All you’d have to do is rub your nose or touch your child’s mouth.**
>
> Searching initially on just fentanyl shopping cart gives a mixed bag of results.

![search results for fentanyl shopping carts](https://checkpleasecc.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Faeccbad2-60c6-4555-83d9-237dcbc3a8c9%2Ffentanyl-click-restraint.png?table=block&id=f6d4005f-5562-4079-9687-44d86d4485d8&spaceId=092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc&width=1280&userId=&cache=v2)

> When we scan the blurbs we find that the first article — even though it is from a reputable source — contains the words fentanyl and shopping cart, but is not really about fentanyl on shopping carts. Likewise, the reference to shopping carts in the second one is to homelessness, not grocery store drug scares. It's the text of the third result that's in line with what we're researching, and that's the one we want to click. (Though once getting there we may want to use our source investigation techniques on Forbes).

**Vocabulary: click restraint**

- **Click restraint** is a term introduced by Sam Wineburg and Sarah McGrew to describe a behavior fact-checkers exhibit that less skilled people do not. Fact-checkers scan multiple results to try and find the particular result that combines trustworthiness with relevance before they click, often visiting the second page of search results.

#### Remember to Stop

> This brings us to the move that often gets forgotten by students: the "S" in SIFT for "stop." As seen above, one aspect of "stopping" is to stop before you reflexively click the top search result. You want to take a second or two to make sure you're clicking the best result, not just the first one you see.
>
> Another aspect of stopping is occasionally reformulating a search. We do see one fact-check in the above results, but perhaps we're surprised we don't see more. Maybe we start reading the Forbes story but find it unclear. If the results are not what we want we can modify the search query, here by adding "fact-check".

![GIF showing fentanyl grocery cart fact check](https://file.notion.so/f/f/092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc/c3a91350-a6af-4be8-87e5-d378b695fd06/fentanyl-shopping-cart-fact-check.gif?id=c6cb61a9-a406-43ad-bcf5-7253bdfa1c69&table=block&spaceId=092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc&expirationTimestamp=1704477600000&signature=VW62nGC4LEiQZ7j3Y9rS3g3hlYbhyXZKAtgqxp-P56w)

> When we do that we see at least a half dozen fact-checks on this from Poynter (a well known fact-checking outfit), CBS News, and others. We choose the CBS News link and find a good explanation of why the fentanyl story is highly improbable, combined with advice that wiping those handles during flu season is something you might want to do anyway.

#### Not Everything In Google News Is Credible

> Although we mentioned this earlier in the course, it bears repeating. Using news search can give you a more trustworthy set of results than web search, but there are still untrustworthy sites in the mix, including a few that publish outright false information.
>
> The same way that you practice click restraint in looking for the most relevant link, you should also practice click restraint and choose the most credible result on the page. It won't always be the first. As we practice this more, choosing the best result will become much easier.

**SIFTing: UN Dance Protesting Nikki Haley (Prompt)**

> Early in 2018 the Trump administration announced that it would withdraw financial support for Palestine unless the country agreed to concessions. U.S. Ambassador Nicki Haley presented the U.S. position on the matter to the U.N. in January.
>
> Then, according to many people on Twitter, something amazing happened. In defiance of the Nicki Haley's pronouncement, the Palestinian delegation got up... and began to dance!

![Screenshot of Sacha Saeen showing what was claimed to be dancing in protest](https://checkpleasecc.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Feaed5dd9-14c1-486b-9644-7421b4961d1f%2Fpalestiniandance.png?table=block&id=e5494464-1feb-46f6-b833-74ad1139baea&spaceId=092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc&width=1240&userId=&cache=v2)

> Text reads: "The Palestinian representative played a song on his mobile phone & danced at the UN as a response to Nikki Haley announcing that the U.S. will be cutting aid to Palestinians unless they recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital."
>
> Fact check this, then answer the following questions in your fact-checking notebook under the heading UN DANCE:

**Questions**

- Is the video unaltered (i.e., a "real" video)?

- Is this video really a reaction to U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley?
- What else can you tell us about this video, and how do you know it?

**SIFTing: UN Dance Protesting Nikki Haley (Discussion)**

> So let's take a look:

![Search for UN dance protest and resulting story on Snopes](https://file.notion.so/f/f/092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc/bf1f55a2-728b-457d-a7ed-2f6a80d4d8fc/haley-un.gif?id=1761eccb-c55f-4cf8-8d4a-0147d19733a5&table=block&spaceId=092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc&expirationTimestamp=1704477600000&signature=Y57vwvEuahlhtzmFvmnXy1J3ShCD8t07Jv2OHUXmigA)

> In this case we could just click the fact-check we see in the general search, assuming we either recognized Snopes or Al-Araby as a reputable source. If we don't recognize those sources or see relevant material, we click into Google News.
>
> Our finding? The clip is miscaptioned. It's not from 2018, it's not about Trump or Nikki Haley or protest. It's an enjoyable but rather unremarkable clip of a 2013 event where a famous Palestinian singer was invited to sing at the United Nations.

#### False Frames

> While there are videos and photos that are fake or manipulated online, a far more common tactic is to take real media and miscaption it. The example above is pretty blatant. But often it is more subtle — and more dangerous.
>
> Take for example this infamous tweet that was posted after the London Bridge bombing.

![photo 'framed' with reference to terror attack](https://checkpleasecc.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F9641551f-5986-48e8-9353-1e1cb2df3e35%2F620.jpg?table=block&id=2ff151f8-21a4-4d8a-a04c-aac3a4b8c2b7&spaceId=092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc&width=1210&userId=&cache=v2)

> The picture is real, but the way the poster would like you to see it is not. The frame here is that a woman wearing a hijab cares so little about victims of Islamic extremist violence that she won't even look up from her phone.
>
> The image pinged around the web with that story, and while this version has blurred out the face, the face was not blurred in the original. People believed this specific woman was a monster.
>
> But was that the frame through which they should have viewed it? After the photo and false frame had circulated through the web the real story emerged. The poster had chosen one of two photos, with the second photo showing that she was clearly in shock:

![Woman with her head covered, looking upset and distraught](https://checkpleasecc.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Fd4e999c3-ed0b-4176-8cfb-bb8fed7733af%2Flondon-attack-woman_2.jpg?table=block&id=82c955d3-2167-46d4-bb45-cb2cb32f7563&spaceId=092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc&width=1400&userId=&cache=v2)

> When news outlets contacted the photographer, he said the woman was like many people that day walking past — she would have just come through a much more devastating scene, and been in shock, and the rescuing teams did not want assistance, they wanted space to do their jobs. Many people were on their phones as they tried to reach relatives. The photo the poster didn't choose clearly shows the trauma and concern.

![people gathered around someone lying on the ground | Reuters/Toby Melville. Used under fair use provision](https://checkpleasecc.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F345a0a17-f3e0-4e53-965a-f05f2cab922e%2Flondon-attack-bridge1.jpg?table=block&id=ce089b16-f9b8-4d86-8589-9c14d08d31a0&spaceId=092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc&width=1400&userId=&cache=v2)

> Because of the falsely framed photo the woman was viciously attacked by others on social media. When contacted by reporters, she mentioned she was [calling her family](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/mar/24/woman-hijab-westminster-bridge-attack-victim-photo-misappropriated) to tell them she was OK:
>
> **She said her feelings at the time were of sadness, fear and concern, and added that she had talked to other witnesses to try to find out what was happening and see if she could offer help. She then called her family and helped a woman get to Waterloo station.**

#### Sharpening the Event

> Some frames aren't wholly false, but are sharpened to the point where they are deceptive. An example of this sort of sharpening was the 2019 Covington student altercation with a Native American drummer in Washington D.C.
>
> In this case, initial footage was shared on Twitter and through other outlets that seemed to show Catholic high school students wearing Make America Great Again hats surrounding a Native elder during a drumming ceremony to mock him.
>
> The characterization was not completely incorrect. But the reaction to the video was heavily influenced by the starting point of the edit. While the framing of the video initially made it seem as if the students surrounded the drummer to mock him, later videos that emerged showed that the drummer had in fact approached the students.
>
> Discussing these things can be difficult, because even after the frame is corrected, the original intensity of feeling still remains. It's particularly hard in this case, because in the full video there are still questions to be asked about appropriate conduct and cultural respect.
>
> But one's emotional reaction to students who actively surround an older man as a mob and block his exit in order to mock his culture is different than one's reaction to watching students respond inappropriately to an older man that approaches them in what they feel is a confusing manner.
>
> In this case both sides lost. Had the longer video been released first, a productive discussion might have been possible. Instead, the initial video fired one group of people into a frenzy, while the revelations of subsequent videos caused the other side to dismiss the behavior entirely.
>
> We'll come back to this point later, when we talk about the "T" in SIFT. But for now remember that even if photos and videos are "real" it's important to check trusted sources to make sure you have the whole story. If it turns out you were reacting to something manipulated or falsely framed, consider that your initial reaction was wrong, and adjust accordingly.

**SIFTing: ATM rats (discussion)**

> In this case there's a lot of good sources on that search page. I chose Reuters, due to their expertise with international reporting, but most choices here are fine. At the time I did this search I saw Newsweek, USA Today, BBC News, Thrillist (a culture site), and Business Insider.
>
> What is our response here? Well it might be something like this:
>
> **The story appears to be true — Google News shows it being reported by multiple outlets including some reputable outlets I recognize. I chose the Reuters article, and looked up Reuters on Wikipedia before reading it. It's a well-known news agency with an international focus. The story itself to me seems a bit fishy (I mean really!?) and maybe I'm just a little suspicious that the camera didn't catch the rat going into the ATM. But the idea the rat ate (or shredded, technically) the money is in fact the consensus of both reporters and the bank authority there, so I'm inclined to go with their take on it.**
>
> One thing to note here: a lot of people get hung up on whether something could possibly be false. And it's good that people are suspicious. There are sloppy reporters out there, and government regulators don't always tell the truth.
>
> But doubt is a position too. Your mileage may vary, but for me, even though I can imagine a scenario in my head where someone steals some money from the ATM then shreds the remaining money and tosses a dead rat in there to blame it on, the truth is I am 13,000 miles away from this event, have not reviewed any of the evidence directly, don't know the local environment, the trustworthiness of the people involved, the sequence of events.
>
> Under such circumstances it's fine to say, yeah, for the moment — given there is a whole universe of police and reporters out there looking at this with resources and insights and skills I don't have — it's most likely that the rat really ate the money. **If new evidence emerges, you can change your mind.**
>
> This is a really subtle point, and we'll talk about it more later.

#### Trading Up

> Often we get trustworthy news from not so trustworthy places. Maximum.com might be a great site, but it's unlikely, in this case, that they individually verified a story in India. They are just re-reporting it. Social media exacerbates the issue, since which article reaches you is more determined by the clickbaity-ness of their headline than the quality of their reporting.
>
> By searching a claim and getting a story from a news source that has a verification process in place you not only verify the claim, but you end up with a better story to share with others. We call this "trading up." The idea behind trading up is that you can use social media to discover stories relevant to you, but when you find the stories, take a moment to "zoom out" and get the best reporting or analysis on it, rather than simply reading the specific article that happens to find its way to you.
>
> When you use social media in this way, you let social media do what it does best (personalized topic discovery) while relying on either news or other search to address social media's big problem (credibility, clickbait, manipulation). If you find a better story on the subject, share that story instead, and in doing so make social media a bit better for everyone.

#### How to use reverse image search to Find Trusted Coverage

> Sometimes (many times!) claims or stories will come to you in the form of images. If you want to find trusted coverage of the issue, claim, or photo, you have a couple options:
>
> - You can search on some relevant text from the image, if, for example it is a meme or a supposed photograph of a sign
> - You can use reverse image search. We show you how to do this in Google Chrome below, but other browsers have similar methods.
>
> Keep in mind that if reverse image search (bullet #2) is difficult due to the device or browser you are using, you can usually get pretty far with the text search of Google Images. 
>
> Watch the video, then go to the next page to check your skills.

**SIFTing: John Lennon's murderer? (prompt)**

On the night of Monday, 8 December 1980, former Beatle and well-known peace activist John Lennon was shot dead by Mark David Chapman in the archway of his residence in New York City. Lennon had just returned from the recording studio with his wife, Yoko Ono.

It is a well-known fact that hours before he shot him, the killer approached John Lennon for an autograph. But this photo has been shared with you with the caption "Creepy photo shows John Lennon signing album for his killer hours before his death!"

**Questions**

Answer the following questions in your fact-checking notebook:

- Is the photo real and unaltered?
- Is this really a photo of John Lennon signing an album for his killer?
- What else do you know about the photograph?

#### Quick note from Dr. B about failure

I'm writing these words on January 4, 2024 (Dr. B). I wanted to break in here and say something about being wrong. I am going through the SIFT modules, again, despite having done so years ago. I use Safari for my web browser, so don't have quite as easy a time doing the reverse-image search as Mike shows in his video and GIFs. Long story short, I wound up finding the story in a tabloid and thought it was therefore fake. When I rewatched Mike's video, I discovered that I had both remembered wrong and followed down a rabbit trail that didn't pay off. 

All of us are going to be wrong in our lives. The strange thing about failure is how much it can benefit us, if we let it. Cognitive researcher Robert Bjork runs a memory lab at UCLA. When I got to talk to him for my podcast, years ago, he said some memorable words. 

> Forgetting is the friend of learning. 
>
> --Robert Bjork

I know it is easy for me to say not to worry if you're not getting all of these prompts right on your first try. Too much of education focuses on high stakes assessments, which don't always measure what they claim to... If you find yourself failing on some of these exercises, be sure to record it in your notebook. It will help deepen your learning. Now back to our regularly-scheduled program: aka Mike Caulfield. 

#### Why Not Examine the Photo Itself?

> One question I get asked from time to time is why I encourage people to look for trusted coverage rather than examine the photo itself for photoshopping. Many people have the experience of having seen something that is obviously fake. So why not look for signs of fakery?

![one of the many examples of the internet meme 'this looks shopped'](https://checkpleasecc.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F6f430e8a-c7e5-428a-81f5-3a4d73bf8a95%2FShopped_sea1.jpg?table=block&id=1cf6a0f2-a67d-431f-8b6c-5e36ddbe1ef0&spaceId=092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc&width=1000&userId=&cache=v2)

> In practice we've found that this approach fails for a number of reasons. The biggest reason? 
>
> Let's provide an example first. The following image is presented online as evidence of a chemical spill in Hungary.

![photo of trees with the lower parts of the trunks all turned brown](https://checkpleasecc.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F50553306-0f83-400d-a307-ba8255345b81%2Ftrees-mining-sludge1.jpg?table=block&id=ce039f9a-8207-4ab9-bcf1-9eddafe09871&spaceId=092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc&width=1630&userId=&cache=v2)



> Is it shopped? Most people would say yes. But, actually, it *isn't*. It's really the effect of one of the worst industrial accidents in recent European history:

Watch: [Video of the tsunami of toxic sludge in Southwest Hungary](https://youtu.be/vjf4e7ZAc9M?si=fkTbmqHo4miNtG71) (2:18m)

> That's an extreme example, with a very weird looking picture, but stare at any image long enough and you'll find something wrong with it. Unless you're an expert in digital manipulation (you're not), it's better to find trusted commentary than pull out the magnifying glass.

**Questions** 

- When would a reverse-image search be more helpful? 
- When would it be more of a waste of time to do a reverse-image search as part of your fact checking? 

#### Conclusion

> In this section you've learned to find trusted coverage when trying to determine if a claim is reliable. You learned three techniques:
>
> - Scanning Google News for relevant stories
> - Using known fact-checking sites
> - Reverse image searching to find relevant sources on an image
>
> Next we'll look at our final move: Tracing claims, quotes, and media to the original context.

### 04.05 | Trace Claims, Quotes, and Media to Their Original Context

> Most stuff you see on the web is not original reporting or research. Instead, it is often commentary on the re-reporting of re-reporting on some original story or piece of research. And that's a problem.
>
> Now, in some cases stories or findings get better as they pass through intermediaries. If I tell a reporter a piece of gossip I heard, and they go out and verify it by talking to eyewitnesses and experts, their report on my piece of gossip is probably more accurate than my gossip. If a scientist gets a result and another scientist with a talent for explaining things blogs it, maybe the second explanation is better than the first. Research also shows that as gossip gets passed around, sometimes important details that were missed become more prominent.
>
> But in most cases, the more a story is passed around, the more it starts to become a bit warped. That's due to a bunch of reasons. Human nature is to exaggerate stories for effect. Desire of websites to get advertising dollars can result in them printing the most shocking version of something. And there are bad actors: people who will take a story that has some nuance to it and remove the details that provide that nuance, or invent details that didn't exist.
>
> Very often by the time a story finds you on the web it has been altered so much that it presents a radically wrong version of an event or a piece of research. The person you are reading usually did no original reporting, made no phone calls to check facts, and often barely skimmed the original story before writing up their blog post, thinkpiece, hot take, or re-reported news item. And so they either get things wrong by mistake, or, in some cases, intentionally mislead.

#### Trace It to the Original

> Fortunately, there is a solution to this problem. Usually, the original reporting, research, or photo is available on the web. By going to the original reporting or research source (or finding a high quality secondary source that did the hard work of verification) you can get a story that is more complete, or a research finding that is more accurate. This two minute video shows you how going to the source can be as easy as clicking through a link:

!?[Online verification skills - Video 3 - find the original source](https://youtu.be/tRZ-N3OvvUs)

#### Leveling, Sharpening, and Assimilation

> Early studies of rumors suggested that as rumors traveled further from the source they were altered in predictable ways. They were"leveled" — as they traveled, details are stripped out. They are also "sharpened" — certain small details are added or emphasized to give the story more "punch". And both of these processes happened in the context of "assimilation" — the details that were omitted and the details that were added or emphasized are chosen because they either fit what the speaker thinks is the main theme of the story, or what the speaker thinks the listener will be most interested in.
>
> Later research called into question the particular nature of these processes, but these three actions are a helpful way of thinking about the sorts of alterations people can make to claims, quotes, and media as they pass them along.
>
> These processes are not necessarily bad. It means that as a story travels it often becomes more concise, more engaging, and more geared toward the interest of its audience. Think of a long-winded story full of details that someone has told you which you have then retold. Assuming you have a credible take on what the story is about, you'll probably forget the irrelevant details, and remember the most memorable ones. So when you retell it, you'll provide a shorter more engaging version customized to your audience. And that's good! One reason many people enjoy getting news from social media is it can be much more *efficient* than a longer news story, calling out the pieces that really matter to you in particular.
>
> But the same way that these processes can provide value in the hands of careful storytellers, they can be damaging in the hands of those who are careless, are guided by strong bias, or are motivated to distort the truth for their own benefit.
>
> Consider this tweet from our old friend John D'oh:

![John D'oh tweets "It might be time to ditch the sunscreen"; headline from moms.com says FDA warns chemicals from sunscreen enter your bloodstream after one day](https://innovatelearning.s3.amazonaws.com/2024-01-04_10-45-18.jpg)

> John is tweeting his takeaway from this article on sunscreen (or at least his takeaway from the article headline):

![Headline from moms.com: FDA warns chemicals from sunscreen enter your bloodstream after one day](https://checkpleasecc.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F568e64df-105a-4850-8013-e9a6742c4f83%2Fchemicals.png?table=block&id=e00512e0-42d7-4ae4-a65e-4e54bea484e5&spaceId=092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc&width=1510&userId=&cache=v2)

> But the article doesn't say to ditch your sunscreen. And it doesn't even say that the FDA is warning people about the chemicals. The study merely concluded that given the levels of the chemicals in the bloodstream — from applying sunscreen four times a day — that additional regulation might be warranted:
>
> > They found that these 24 participants had higher than what is recommended of these chemicals in their blood. This amount is based on what the FDA’s says is how much of these active ingredient can be in someone’s bloodstream before it needs to be tested for safety concerns...
>
> This article isn't from a reliable source, and is in fact pulling all its quotes from another article. It's reporting on reporting. If you click through to the link (supposedly to the research article) it links to a CNN story.
>
> And in that story you notice the re-reporters left something out:
>
> > So, should you stop using sunscreen? Absolutely not, experts say.
> >
> > "Studies need to be performed to evaluate this finding and determine whether there are true medical implications to absorption of certain ingredients," said Yale School of Medicine dermatologist Dr. David Leffell, a spokesman for the American Academy of Dermatology. He added that in the meantime, people should "continue to be aggressive about sun protection."
>
> The original story *actually says the opposite* of what the tweeter proposed.
>
> You could trace it back even further, but we can stop there. A story came out that mentioned the research, but made it clear that there is not any known danger yet, and that people should continue to use the sunscreen they are using in the meantime. That gets rewritten, with that detail omitted or downplayed (leveled). It then gets summarized by John D'oh — who "sharpens" the advice, and ends up stating the exact opposite of what the original story said.
>
> When looking at information of this sort, figure out what the original reporting source was, and go take a look. Some publications can add value, particularly if reporters are experienced and knowledgeable in the field they are reporting in. But if it's clear the thing your looking at is just re-reporting of reporting, go up to the source and once at the source do your normal (I)nvestigate the Source moves.

#### Beware the Sourceless Story

> Consider this post by John D'oh, in which he references [an article from Curious Mind Magazine](https://curiousmindmagazine.com/research-shows-born-creative-geniuses-education-dumb-us/):



![John D'oh tweet: "I've said it before and will say it again -- school kills creativity. Looks like NASA agrees with me, according to this research"](https://innovatelearning.s3.amazonaws.com/2024-01-04_11-01-06.jpg)

> If you go to that story you'll find references to a "NASA study" — however, when you click on the link it's not to the study (which was apparently from 1968) but rather to a summary of the study in an information technology magazine from the 2005. The study itself appears to never have been published directly or reported on contemporaneously. You can keep digging, and what you'll eventually find is what citations that exist to the study are not to the 1968 study, but a 1992 book Land wrote with his wife which told the story of the study he had done over 20 years before. Importantly the study wasn't even a NASA study: it was a study he did privately using a test that he had developed for NASA. It's unclear what NASA's take was on the test, since, again, the only account we have of it is from 1992.
>
> This is not to doubt Land's honesty. But the perceived authority of the study for many readers comes from the idea it was conducted by NASA and was substantial research at the time. When you attempt to trace the claim to the original context you find that the trail ends in 1992, it was not published at the time, and was not conducted by NASA. That changes how you might view the claim.

**Beer tax (prompt)**

> Take a look at [the tweet](https://x.com/JuddLegum/status/935512580155731968?s=20) below, which links to [a story from think progress.org](https://thinkprogress.org/alcohol-tax-cuts-c62a5bb7e90f/).

![Judd Legum tweet: Provision quietly tucked in GOP tax bill could lead to 1k people dying every year](/Users/bonni/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20240104110852747.png)

> You see multiple sources here, but what's the *original* research source? Click through until you find the original report.

Once you find the original report answer two questions in your fact-checking notebook:

- What is the reputation of the organization or person producing the report? How credible are they on this claim?
- What's the 1,000 people dying about? How does an alcohol tax affect that?

**Beer tax (discussion)**

> To solve this, we click to the page linked in the tweet, and scan it for links to the original report (or the original summary of the report). We find one such link:

![a segment of the page with the phrase "report estimates that" highlighted. "Estimates" is linked.](https://checkpleasecc.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F32cc436d-3717-420f-add6-7b795fe2c1f8%2Fbeertax.png?table=block&id=17b7b2de-0068-4bd6-8d9a-c0939adbeccd&spaceId=092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc&width=1470&userId=&cache=v2)

> That report seems to be the source of the claim, so we click through and find a summary of the finding from Adam Looney at the Brookings institution. And he has a link that shows his math.

![Headline: Measuring the loss of life from the senate's tax cuts for alcohol producers; with 'read more here on how I arrived at this estimate' highlighted and linked ](https://checkpleasecc.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F4ffb6854-7cc0-4776-bddf-ddad1c9a9d6d%2FUntitled.png?table=block&id=049093c9-3ddc-41c5-8de2-78cc16fdca45&spaceId=092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc&width=2000&userId=&cache=v2)

> The truth is we're not (most of us) risk researchers or even working economists. We're not going to be able to judge whether he is being fair about the math, whether he's citing consensus risk models or fringe stuff. We only have his reputation to go by.
>
> It's a contentious issue, with a lot of complexity, so our goal here is not figuring out whether he is right. Our goal is to figure out how seriously to take that estimate. Is it junk, or is it worth considering? Do we keep reading, or do we go somewhere else?
>
> So our second move, now that we *know* the original source, is to *investigate* the source.

![GIF showing search for Brookings institution on wikipedia](https://file.notion.so/f/f/092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc/92c7bd86-0ffd-4bfe-b4bc-06f1cf17a553/brookings.gif?id=0e631aea-c7f0-4c83-9e9b-6dfe142a7853&table=block&spaceId=092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc&expirationTimestamp=1704484800000&signature=PYudmnkQekqU2HL76c5LMQC71uyN1ndYaLCUjqJJNRI)

> In this case, a search for Brookings on Wikipedia shows that Brookings is a well respected think-tank that conducts this sort of policy analysis regularly, has a high marks for credibility, and seems to be centrist in political leanings, and not explicitly partisan.

#### Your Research Shopping Cart

> The search above gave you a good result on Brookings — good enough for you to take the analysis seriously, in any case. Good enough for you to share this with others if that's what you want to do.
>
> But I cannot stress enough that it doesn't mean you have to agree with the analysis. In fact, if you want to form an informed opinion on this question, you probably want to move to that (F) in SIFT, and find other trusted coverage on this issue of alcohol taxes and death rates. See what others say.
>
> Students (and even teachers, sometimes) often want these things to resolve one way or another. Is this person right, or are they wrong? True or false? With some questions there's that sort of clarity, and we shouldn't hesitate to make simple judgments when simple judgments are merited.
>
> For something like this, however, I like to think of it like food shopping. Maybe you're interested in this question of alcohol taxes. You go around the information supermarket, and you look at the (metaphorical) nutrition labels, and the question is not "Is this the only thing I will eat?" The question "Is this healthy enough to go in the shopping cart?"
>
> The above analysis is healthy enough to go in the cart, and healthy enough to share with others. But if you have questions or concerns you should keep shopping! Just make sure that for the additional sources you consume you check those nutrition labels too.

**Guns in schools (prompt)** 

> The NRA — a political advocacy organization — currently argues that the correct response to school shootings is arming teachers and school personnel. In light of that position, a pro-gun control organization called Everytown circulated the following graphic:

!["We believe in absolutely gun-free, zero tolerance, totally safe schools. That means no guns in America's schools period." - Wayne LaPierre](https://checkpleasecc.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F0c8900e7-1240-4530-b321-e18e9e2194f2%2Fdwppqasw4ausrnp.jpg?table=block&id=7e3c3a4c-adcb-4173-9bb4-29d72776ae36&spaceId=092af283-56b1-460c-aaed-5b228f26afbc&width=1630&userId=&cache=v2)

> If NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre said that in 1999, it looks like a dramatic change in approach.
>
> Find the source of the quote, and read it in it's original context. For this one, do not stop at a fact-checker, but track the quote all the way to the transcript of the C-Span video where he said it.

**Questions**

- Do you feel this portrayal of a major shift in policy is fair? Why or why not?

**Guns in schools (discussion)**

> There are numerous fact-checks of this out there, but we asked you to look at the source of the quote itself in this instance. To do that you can either find it directly through search, or be lazy like me: go to a fact-checking page and click through to the video linked in it. Most fact-checkers link to the C-SPAN video:

[NRA convention video on CSPAN](https://www.c-span.org/video/?122961-1/national-rifle-association-convention&start=2290)

> If you go there you'll find there's a little box that allows you to search the text of the speech.

> People may have different opinions on whether the Everytown graphic is accurate. It's certainly the case that he seems to be primarily talking about *students* not having guns. On the other hand, the "rare exception" language seems to indicate that the 1999 version of Wayne LaPierre would not have dreamed of saying *teachers* should carry weapons. 
>
> As with so many of our examples, the truth is a bit more nuanced than it appears at first. And while knowing the nuance may not change your opinion on the issue, understanding what is genuinely new here will help better focus your efforts on the things you care about, no matter which side of the issue you find yourself on.
