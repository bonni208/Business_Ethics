### Why take a business ethics class

Taking a business ethics class is crucial for college students, especially at a Christian university, as it prepares future leaders to navigate the complex ethical challenges that arise in the modern business world. With innovations such as artificial intelligence and facial recognition technology, the number of ethical dilemmas in business is increasing. As new technologies emerge, their long-term impacts, both positive and negative, may not be apparent until they have been in use for some time, as seen with the [effects of social media on children and teenagers].

As Christians, we are called to love our neighbors, tell the truth, and seek to live our God’s love in the world. While you will see references to biblical principles such as the golden rule in this class, it is not intended to be a theology class. Instead, you will be invited to reflect on your values, which often might intersect with Christian ones, while also recognizing that most of us will go on to work in professional contexts that require us to work with people who are different than us and who follow other faith traditions of belief systems. 

Business ethics are the principles that guide decision-making and are vital for transparency, inviting feedback, considering the impacts on employees, stakeholders, and society, and reflecting on past experiences. 

Watch: The Importance of Business Ethics

The speaker in [The Importance of Business Ethics] discusses the importance of ethical behavior in business and the consequences of unethical actions. It presents scenarios illustrating ethical dilemmas, cites examples of unethical corporate behavior, and emphasizes the negative impacts of a lack of ethics in organizations. The video highlights the significance of adhering to protected values and how ethical behavior can lead to improved employee morale, productivity, and long-term profitability, while unethical actions can harm a company's reputation and investor confidence.

Ethical responsibilities extend to society by promoting sustainable practices and corporate social responsibility (CSR), which are increasingly expected by customers, employees, and investors. To customers, ethical responsibilities include avoiding misleading practices like greenwashing and false advertising. Ethical treatment of employees is also crucial, as fair practices contribute to a successful organizational culture, which can benefit the company economically and legally.

Watch: Sandel first video

In the first lecture of his course on moral reasoning, Michael Sandel presents a hypothetical scenario to his students: Would you kill one person to save the lives of five others? Is it the right thing to do? This scenario launches a discussion on moral reasoning and the complexity of making ethical decisions in extreme situations.



These questions cover key aspects of the trolley problem and the utilitarian ethical framework, exploring the decision-making process and the philosophical underpinnings of utilitarianism.

Here are five multiple-choice questions regarding the trolley problem and utilitarianism:



**What is the main ethical dilemma in the trolley problem?**

[[ ]] Choosing between two equally beneficial outcomes.
[[ ]] Deciding whether to intervene in a natural disaster.
[[ ]] Determining the best outcome, using your gut instinct.
[[x]] Choosing between a direct action that saves more lives at the cost of fewer or inaction that results in more deaths.



**In utilitarianism, what is considered the most ethical action?**

[[ ]] The action that benefits the most powerful individuals.
[[ ]] The action that aligns with traditional moral values.
[[x]] The action that produces the greatest good for the greatest number.
[[ ]] The action that is easiest to perform and efficient.



**How does the trolley problem challenge utilitarian principles?**

[[ ]] It questions the value of individual rights.
[[ ]] It creates a scenario where no one is truly happy.
[[ ]] It presents a situation where all choices lead to a bad outcome.
[[x]] It forces a choice between the greater good and individual morality.



**Which philosopher is most closely associated with the development of utilitarianism?**

[[ ]]  Immanuel Kant.
[[x]] John Stuart Mill.
[[ ]] Friedrich Nietzsche.
[[ ]] Socrates.



**In the trolley problem, if you choose to divert the trolley to save five people but kill one, you are primarily applying which ethical principle?**

[[ ]] Deontological ethics.
[[ ]] Virtue ethics.
[[x]] Utilitarian ethics.
[[ ]] Existential ethics.
