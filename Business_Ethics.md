# Start

This course is designed to be engaging, challenging, and practical, encouraging you to think deeply about your roles in shaping the ethical landscape of business. My hope is that you will 'show up' for it in the fullness of who you are and that together we will cultivate the kind of environment that is necessary for that kind of vulnerability to be possible. The is made up of ten lessons [^1] and ten challenges[^2]. Each lesson is designed to generate curiosity and help reinforce the relevance of the content. Each challenge provides opportunities to apply the learning in your unique context and to take time out for personal reflection.

[^1]: My inspiration for the synchronicity involved in having ten lessons and ten challenges comes from the incredible Mike Wesch. His [Anth101](https://anth101.com) cultural anthropology course site continues to stretch and expand my imagination, each time I visit it.
[^2]: As I think back to my college classes, the ones that I still draw from today, all these decades later, are the ones in which I was challenged in some way outside the normal class time. One professor who is particularly memorable at having done so was [Bernard McGrane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_McGrane). In his sociology classes, we would be asked to break a social norm in some way, like entering an elevator in a busy business complex and not immediately turn around and look at the direction that the door would open, when we reached our floor. Pretty much all my assignments were me writing about how I just couldn't allow myself to break out of the norm in the ways his assignments described. I rarely get into an elevator to this day (decades later) without thinking of him. 


## Why take a business ethics class

Taking a business ethics class is crucial for people looking to better understand the ways in which decision making and our beliefs get challenged, tested, and refined in the workplace, as a consumer, or as a business owner. Especially for those who claim a Christian worldview, a class like this can help prepare future leaders to navigate the complex ethical challenges that arise in the business world. With innovations such as artificial intelligence and facial recognition technology, the number of ethical dilemmas in business is increasing. As new technologies emerge, their long-term impacts, both positive and negative, may not be apparent until they have been in use for some time, as seen with the effects of social media on children and teenagers[^1].

As Christians, we are called to love our neighbors, tell the truth, and seek to live our God’s love in the world. While you will see references to biblical principles such as the golden rule in this class, it is not intended to be a theology class. Instead, you will be invited to reflect on your values, which often will intersect with ones embedded throughout Christianity, broadly speaking. Recognizing that most of us will go on to work in professional contexts that require us to work with people who are different than us and who follow other faith traditions or belief systems, you're going to be asked to express your perspectives in such a way as to be understood by people who have diverse worldviews. 

### The importance of business ethics

Business ethics are the principles that guide decision-making and are vital for transparency, inviting feedback, considering the impacts on employees, stakeholders, and society, and reflecting on past experiences. 

The speaker in [The Importance of Business Ethics] discusses the importance of ethical behavior in business and the consequences of unethical actions. It presents scenarios illustrating ethical dilemmas, cites examples of unethical corporate behavior, and emphasizes the negative impacts of a lack of ethics in organizations. The video highlights the significance of adhering to protected values and how ethical behavior can lead to improved employee morale, productivity, and long-term profitability, while unethical actions can harm a company's reputation and investor confidence.

Ethical responsibilities extend to society by promoting sustainable practices and corporate social responsibility (CSR), which are increasingly expected by customers, employees, and investors. To customers, ethical responsibilities include avoiding misleading practices like greenwashing and false advertising. Ethical treatment of employees is also crucial, as fair practices contribute to a successful organizational culture, which can benefit the company economically and legally.

[^1]: There's a lot more nuance regarding social media's impact on youth. The [Pew Research Center has some key findings from 2023](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/04/24/teens-and-social-media-key-findings-from-pew-research-center-surveys/) to explore for more. 

## About me

Since the age of five, I knew what I was going to do for a living. I would have my stuffed animals and dolls set carfully out in my room, approximating a classroom. My mom had bought me materials from a local educational store. I had the books that my 'students' could use, as well as the 'teachers' edition, used to guide me in my pedagogy. My bedroom door had a sign hung on it, which read: Room 208. The name I used was Miss. Monroe, a testiment to the power of the 1970s version of the tv show Charlie's Angels' characters in my life at the time. 

When I was in college, picking a major was easy. I majored in social sciences, meaning I got to pick three of my favorite subjects to focus on: psychology, sociology, and history. I was certain that I would graduate with a single subject waiver to teach high school classes and would earn my teaching credential during what would have been my fifth year in college. I did graduate on time with a bachelors degree in social sciences, but my adventures in teaching have taken me plenty of places, but never inside a high school classroom. 

I have always wanted to teach. 

Fast forward to today. I teach as a professor of business and management at Vanguard. I'm also dean of teaching and learning, which gives  me opportunities to collaborate with other faculty to improve all of our teaching and support efforts that allow students to thrive in their learning. My passion is in continually becoming more effective facilitating learning for students. I’m also fortunate to get to coach faculty in my dean role. 

Since June of 2014, I have been airing weekly podcast episodes of [Teaching in Higher Ed](https://teachinginhighered.com). I started podcasting upon the urging of my husband, Dave, who I had met while earning my MA degree in Organizational Leadership. He had started the [Coaching for Leaders](https://coachingforleaders.com) podcast three years prior to his nudging for me to launch one. Given how much I enjoy talking about teaching and learning, I'm grateful for the ways in which those hundreds of conversations have shaped me all these years. 

I've been married to Dave since April of 2005. It took us many years and lots of medical interventions, but our two kids came into the world and have been surprising and delighting us ever since. One of my favorite things about being a parent is how infectious our son's and daughter's collective curiosity can be. 

### More about me can be found online

If you would like to learn more about me, I have a fairly active presence online, including: 

- [Teaching in Higher Ed](https://teachinginhighered.com/) - website with my weekly podcast episodes, rare blog posts, and speaking resources from when I'm invited to share at other universities or conferences about teaching and learning
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bonnistachowiak/) - professional connections and occasional reflection posts
- [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/bonni208) - personal connections and occasional pics of what I'm up to

### Show up for the work 

![Dr. B holds a sign that reads: 'show up for the work'](https://innovatelearning.s3.amazonaws.com/BonniHeadshots2022-46.jpg)

Those social media profiles that include a cover image as part of what we are invited to set up, I often post a picture of me, sitting in my Vanguard office, holding a sign that reads: 

> Show up for the work. 

This is inspiration taken from the life of Christian author Rachel Held Evans, who sadly passed away in her late 30s. Her legacy lives on, in terms of inviting us to think seriously about what we believe and be open to changing our minds. She had a sign hanging above her writing desk that said those same words, representative of her vulnerability in spending time and being in relationship with people who thought differently than she did about important issues in the world. 

## How this class works

Speaking of showing up for the work, that's something that's important for you to do in this class. Yet, the act of showing up might look quite different, depending on your unique context and preferences. This isn't an easy class (at least that's what I've been told), but it is one that provides radical flexibility, in terms of how you can show up.

Discuss how it went for you going through the ethical decision making part 1. Are you at all familiar with the ethical concerns involved in medical research, or was more of this new to you? Did you notice any of the items you had to sort evoking strong reactions from you? What ones seemed super easy to categorize and why do you think that was? As you sorted them, what items made you think about how they show up in other contexts outside a medical research one? How have you seen some of these questions raised in this exercise show up in aspects of your life?

### 03.01 - What's the right thing to do? The moral side of murder | 50 minutes | #watch #seek

Watch: Sandel first video

In the first lecture of his course on moral reasoning, Michael Sandel presents a hypothetical scenario to his students: Would you kill one person to save the lives of five others? Is it the right thing to do? This scenario launches a discussion on moral reasoning and the complexity of making ethical decisions in extreme situations.

Discuss Justice - Part 1

The following discussion questions are adapted from Michael Sandel's materials. Answer the three questions posed below, as a means of reflecting further on the first Justice video. Refrain from looking up answers on the internet, as I want to discover what you think is the right thing to do here, not be influenced by what others think, or have thought in the past... 

Each question should prompt answers from you that are at least 4-5 sentences. You may alternatively record a video for each of the questions (please do the answers on separate videos, should you choose this route). Paste the link to each video in your reply. 

------

Let’s start with utilitarianism. According to the principle of utility, we should always do whatever will produce the greatest amount of happiness and whatever is necessary to prevent the greatest amount of unhappiness. But is that right? Should you always try to maximize happiness? Should you always do whatever is necessary to minimize unhappiness?

------

1. There are times when the only way to prevent harm to a large number of people is to harm a smaller number of people. Is it always permissible to harm a smaller number in order to prevent harm to a large number? 
2. Suppose you are driving through a narrow tunnel and a worker falls onto the road in front of you. There is not enough time for you to stop. If you keep straight, you will hit the worker and kill him, but if you swerve left into oncoming traffic, you will collide with a school bus and kill at least five children. What’s the right thing to do? Does utilitarianism have the right answer? 
3. Ten thousand innocent civilians live next to a munitions factory in a country at war. If you bomb the factory, all of them will die. If you don’t bomb the factory, it will be used to produce bombs that will be dropped on fifty thousand innocent civilians in another country. What’s the right thing to do?

Hint: It was a type of cake, yes, but was it a birthday cake, or some other type? 



Which one of the following was NOT one of the ways that the video suggested a company could organize their goals to align with the SDGs?

[[ ]] Environmental goals

[[ ]] Employee goals

[[ ]] Community goals

[[ ]] Worldwide goals



You notice that the U.S. is performing higher than a less-developed country in the SDGs. Explain why solely looking at that measure may be misleading. 

Which of the two SDGs are you most personally interested in learning more about and finding out how you may be able to contribute to improving around the world? In your answer, link to the information about each of the two goals you list from the [17 goals websiteLinks to an external site.](https://sdgs.un.org/goals).

EXAMPLE:

[Goal 12: Ensure sustainable consumption and production patternsLinks to an external site.](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal12) - I'm interested in this goal because when I think about how much food gets wasted just in our family, it pains me to extend that out to the world... Currently, our consumption patterns are built to continue and even extend those habits. This one also interests me as it relates to fast fashion, which is [shared about on the SDB websiteLinks to an external site.](https://sdgs.un.org/news/conscious-fashion-and-lifestyle-action-network-25073). 

Answers should include:
