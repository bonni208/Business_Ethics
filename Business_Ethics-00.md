I am so glad you're here. While I have taught this class well over ten times, this time feels different. In the Spring of 2024, I have decided to 'burn the class down to the ground' and rebuild it in a format inspired by some of the greatest teachers I have ever met. Also, each class is unique and I am so looking forward to us becoming an us in the coming weeks. 

> Watch the following video to get to know a few things about me, as well as discover a bit about our class.

# Start

This course is designed to be engaging, challenging, and practical, encouraging you to think deeply about your roles in shaping the ethical landscape of business. My hope is that you will 'show up' for it in the fullness of who you are and that together we will cultivate the kind of environment that is necessary for that kind of vulnerability to be possible. The is made up of ten lessons [^1] and ten challenges[^2]. Each lesson is designed to generate curiosity and help reinforce the relevance of the content. Each challenge provides opportunities to apply the learning in your unique context and to take time out for personal reflection. 

At certain parts of my life, I have felt stuck deciding on what seemed like two, binary choices. Like those old fashioned tv game shows where you had to pick door A or door B. 

![Game show in the style of 1950s with two doors as choices: A or B](https://innovatelearning.s3.amazonaws.com/game-show-choice.png)

Someone I worked with reminded me that there are hardly only just two options we might pick in our lives. The options are boundless. But, also, Henry Nouwen reminds us in the following quote that God is with us, through all the choices we make in our life and we can rest easy in that. 

> There is no such thing as the right place, the right job, the right calling or ministry. I can be happy or unhappy in all situations. I am sure of it, because I have been â€¦ deciding to do this, that, or the other for the next five, ten, or twenty years is no great decision. Turning fully, unconditionally, and without fear to God is. Yet this awareness sets me free.

> -- Henry J.M. Nouwen 

Thank you for taking the time out of your week to get started with Business Ethics (aka BUSN 435). 

![LEGO bricks - AI generated - university campus](https://innovatelearning.s3.amazonaws.com/busn435-lego-bricks-00-start.png)

*While not an actual LEGO set you can buy (nor am I quite that huge in real life), I'm looking forward to us being able to use our creativity together this semester to create something memorable. Not sold in stores. Not available in real life. Not Vanguard's actual campus. Not absent of bias.[^3] You get the idea...* 

[^1]: My inspiration for the synchronicity involved in having ten lessons and ten challenges comes from the incredible Mike Wesch. His [Anth101](https://anth101.com) cultural anthropology course site continues to stretch and expand my imagination, each time I visit it.
[^2]: As I think back to my college classes, the ones that I still draw from today, all these decades later, are the ones in which I was challenged in some way outside the normal class time. One professor who is particularly memorable at having done so was [Bernard McGrane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_McGrane). In his sociology classes, we would be asked to break a social norm in some way, like entering an elevator in a busy business complex and not immediately turn around and look at the direction that the door would open, when we reached our floor. Pretty much all my assignments were me writing about how I just couldn't allow myself to break out of the norm in the ways his assignments described. I rarely get into an elevator to this day (decades later) without thinking of him. 
[^3]: You probably figured this out, already, but I created that LEGO box image using artificial intelligence. Perhaps some of may have also noticed that none of the students depicted in the picture appear as if they are women. The first time I asked the bot to create an image of a female professor with blonde hair and glasses, the minifig of the professor was of a man (with a scruffy mustache and beard) with long, blonde hair.  We will be talking a lot about this in class, but bias exists all around us, and within us. And the more we can 'name' when it happens, the more we can seek to create a more just and equitable world. In the meantime, enjoy the LEGO box (with more to come throughout our class). 



## 00. Let's get it started 

![course header - lesson one](https://innovatelearning.s3.amazonaws.com/busn435-course-header-lesson-00-1.jpg)

Welcome to Business Ethics (BUSN435) at Vanguard University. Throughout your experience of taking ten lessons and then experiencing ten challenges, you will grapple with essential questions about living a life of character and remaining true to your faith within the context of business. My aim is to equip you with the tools and insights necessary to navigate the complex landscape of ethical decision-making in the business world while upholding the values and principles rooted in your beliefs. Through these experiences, I hope to empower you to become an ethical leader who inspires positive change and positively impacts your professional and personal spheres.

> As you progress through this lesson, be sure to watch the videos, read the text, and answer the review questions are you are presented with them. More information is available on Canvas about what's expected, along with due dates, etc. 

One thing you're going to find about me is that I love music. Almost 100% of the time, there's a soundtrack playing in my head. So, if someone says something like: "Let's get it started," my mind is going instantly to music. Like [this song by The Black Eyed Peas](https://youtu.be/IKqV7DB8Iwg?si=AQ-9V0Y4VTCRM0z5). 

> I know I just told you to be sure to watch all the videos. YOU CAN SKIP THIS ONE, because it is just a song. Unless you are really ready to get it started. ðŸ˜‚ðŸŽ¯ðŸŽ‰

Let's go. 

### 00.01 | Why take a business ethics class | 50 min

Speaking of decisions, there are likely many reasons a person may decide to take a class about business ethics. 

**Requirement.** I often hear people say that they needed it to meet some requirement (whether that be for accounting majors to hit the number of units they need to eventually earn a CPA license someday, or for a business major who needs upper division business elective units). 

**Flexibility.** Sometimes students tell me that the flexibility of the course gave them the option to design their schedule to meet their needs (whether that be because they're an athlete and they can better navigate practice times and games, or because they have work during many of the weeks when most of us will be meeting on Zoom). 

**The professor.** Finally, some people say that they have had me for classes, previously, and that they're excited for another adventure together. I don't take that lightly, as it is truly a joy to get to learn with others and I'm glad you have decided to take another class with me. 

**You're not sure ~ yet.** It's also quite possible you don't know yet why you're taking this class. Perhaps as you put together your schedule, everything didn't fall into place like you had hoped it would. My encouragement to you is to consider this week all of your schedule and determine if there are any changes you want to make, as when I was in college, I didn't think as intentionally as I might have liked to do about all the possibilities. If this is you, I don't want you to think you're alone. 

--{{0}}--

Taking a business ethics class is crucial for people looking to better understand the ways in which decision making and our beliefs get challenged, tested, and refined in the workplace, as a consumer, or as a business owner. Especially for those who claim a Christian worldview, a class like this can help prepare future leaders to navigate the complex ethical challenges that arise in the business world. 

As Christians, we are called to love our neighbors, tell the truth, and seek to live our Godâ€™s love in the world. While you will see references to biblical principles such as the golden rule in this class, it is not intended to be a theology class. Instead, you will be invited to reflect on your values, which often will intersect with ones embedded throughout Christianity, broadly speaking. Recognizing that most of us will go on to work in professional contexts that require us to work with people who are different than us and who follow other faith traditions or belief systems, you're going to be asked to express your perspectives in such a way as to be understood by people who have diverse worldviews. 

> I sent an email out to those who were registered for the class a few weeks back, asking for you to reply to let me know why you're taking a class about business ethics. If you haven't done so, already, please email me and share your reasoning and what you hope to get out of the course. 

#### It's more important than sword fighting

When I first started working at Vanguard, I had my first teaching assistant (TA). His name was Brandon and he was about to graduate. To finish up his coursework, he needed units, but they could be in anything he wanted to take. I thought it was so cool that he got to take sword fighting[^1], even though he wasn't a theatre major and never set foot on the stage. The class would practice on the Heath lawn and sometimes I would catch glimpses of them out there, looking like they were having a blast. 

This may be controversial, but for most people (besides theatre majors), I'm going to go out on a limb and say that business ethics is more important than sword fighting. If you find this offensive, reach out to me. Let's talk. I'm open to being wrong on this one. Speaking of sword fighting, I don't think I can reference it without putting [a clip from of one of my favorite movies of all time: The Princess Bride](https://youtu.be/I73sP93-0xA?si=dRfer2WimjEO2f53). 

!?[The Princess Bride movie clip - My Name is Inigo Montoya (1987)](https://youtu.be/I73sP93-0xA?si=dRfer2WimjEO2f53)

I'm pretty sure that Brandon never got as good as those actors in The Princess Bride at stage combat while at Vanguard, but he sure did brighten my days and I'm glad to have known him. I should probably get back to why someone may want to take a class about business ethics. 

[^1]: I'm realizing now that the class was (maybe still is?) called stage combat. But sword fighting seems so much better that I'm going to leave the error in and just go with it. If you need some help with accepting mistakes, you've got to listen to David Wilcox signing [Leave It Like It Is](https://youtu.be/S7mkdHQX-NE?si=xpb8WTS0ZSUKR7NL). I love listening to it and being reminded not to take myself and my human foibles so seriously. 

#### You will have a guide for life

I realize that part about having a guide for life sounds pretty dramatic. But I truly believe that the more we understand about ethics, in general, and the context that most of us will spend a huge percentage of our lives (work), the more we will be able to bring more of God's love into the world. 

A definition seems in order right about now: 

> Business ethics are the principles that guide decision-making and are vital for transparency, inviting feedback, considering the impacts on employees, stakeholders, and society, and reflecting on past experiences. 

Most of us like to consider ourselves ethical people. However, without being aware of the contexts in which we may be faced with incredibly challenging decisions, ones for which there are not easy answers, we are likely to make a choice that may not align with our espoused values. Every year we seem to hear about a company involved in some sort of ethical scandal affecting workers, customers, society as a whole, or the environment. Watch [The Importance of Business Ethics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHrDUu4Rjtg) to explore this further. 

> The speaker in [The Importance of Business Ethics](https://youtu.be/pHrDUu4Rjtg?si=Wra8DhuTZi21FcfV) discusses the importance of ethical behavior in business and the consequences of unethical actions. The video presents scenarios illustrating ethical dilemmas, cites examples of unethical corporate behavior, and emphasizes the negative impacts of a lack of ethics in organizations. Discover the significance of adhering to protected values and how ethical behavior can lead to improved employee morale, productivity, and long-term profitability, while recognizing how unethical actions can harm a company's reputation and investor confidence.

[[X]] True
[[ ]] False

According to the video, a company's relationship with investors has no impact on ethical standards.

[[ ]] True
[[X]] False

[[X]] True
[[ ]] False

What does the video primarily discuss?

[[ ]] Benefits of coffee consumption
[[X]] Ethical dilemmas in business
[[ ]] The history of Starbucks
[[ ]] Employee loyalty

According to the video, what is the quickest way to lose trust with employees?

[[ ]] Demanding high ethical standards

[[ ]]  Conducting experiments

What did the individuals in Wagner's experiment receive $5 for?

[[ ]] Reporting ethical breaches
[[X]] Flipping tails four times
[[ ]]  Lying to their employers
[[ ]] Treating customers unethically

Ethical responsibilities extend to society by promoting sustainable practices and corporate social responsibility (CSR), which are increasingly expected by customers, employees, and investors. To customers, ethical responsibilities include avoiding misleading practices like greenwashing and false advertising. With innovations such as artificial intelligence and facial recognition technology, the number of ethical dilemmas in business is increasing. 

As new technologies emerge, their long-term impacts, both positive and negative, may not be apparent until they have been in use for some time, as seen with the effects of social media on children and teenagers[^1]. Ethical treatment of employees is also crucial, as fair practices contribute to a successful organizational culture, which can benefit the company economically and legally.

[^1]: There's a lot more nuance regarding social media's impact on youth. The [Pew Research Center has some key findings from 2023](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/04/24/teens-and-social-media-key-findings-from-pew-research-center-surveys/) to explore for more. 

#### You're joining someone who finds utter joy in teaching and learning

Since the age of five, I knew what I was going to do for a living. I would have my stuffed animals and dolls set carfully out in my room, approximating a classroom. My mom had bought me materials from a local educational store. I had the books that my 'students' could use, as well as the 'teachers' edition, used to guide me in my pedagogy. My bedroom door had a sign hung on it, which read: Room 208. The name I used was Miss. Monroe, a testiment to the power of the 1970s version of the tv show Charlie's Angels' characters in my life at the time. 

When I was in college, picking a major was easy. I majored in social sciences, meaning I got to pick three of my favorite subjects to focus on: psychology, sociology, and history. I was certain that I would graduate with a single subject waiver to teach high school classes and would earn my teaching credential during what would have been my fifth year in college. I did graduate on time with a bachelors degree in social sciences, but my adventures in teaching have taken me plenty of places, but never inside a high school classroom. 

> I have always wanted to teach. 

Fast forward to today. I teach as a professor of business and management at Vanguard. I'm also dean of teaching and learning, which gives  me opportunities to collaborate with other faculty to improve all of our teaching and support efforts that allow students to thrive in their learning. My passion is in continually becoming more effective facilitating learning for students. Iâ€™m also fortunate to get to coach faculty and support them in my dean role. 

![Bonni podcasting](https://innovatelearning.s3.amazonaws.com/bonni-podcasting.jpg)

Since June of 2014, I have been airing weekly podcast episodes of [Teaching in Higher Ed](https://teachinginhighered.com). I started podcasting upon the urging of my husband, Dave, who I had met while earning my MA degree in Organizational Leadership. He had started the [Coaching for Leaders](https://coachingforleaders.com) podcast three years prior to his nudging for me to launch one. Given how much I enjoy talking about teaching and learning, I'm grateful for the ways in which those hundreds of conversations have shaped me all these years. 

I've been married to Dave since April of 2005. It took us many years and lots of medical interventions, but our two kids came into the world and have been surprising and delighting us ever since. One of my favorite things about being a parent is how infectious our son's and daughter's collective curiosity can be. 

If you would like to learn more about me, I have a fairly active presence online, including: 

- [Teaching in Higher Ed](https://teachinginhighered.com/) - website with my weekly podcast episodes, rare blog posts, and speaking resources from when I'm invited to share at other universities or conferences about teaching and learning
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bonnistachowiak/) - professional connections and occasional reflection posts
- [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/bonni208) - personal connections and occasional pics of what I'm up to
- [BUSN435 Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/busn435/) - an opportunity for us to experience #OpenEducation, to the extent we are comfortable to do so ~ this account is for our class, specifically 

![BUSN435 Instagram account, displaying a few sample quotes and the profile for the account](https://innovatelearning.s3.amazonaws.com/2024-01-08_10-32-41.jpg)

#### If you show up for the work, you may just find your life transformed

![Dr. B holds a sign that reads: 'show up for the work'](https://innovatelearning.s3.amazonaws.com/BonniHeadshots2022-46.jpg)

Those social media profiles that include a cover image as part of what we are invited to set up, I often post a picture of me, sitting in my Vanguard office, holding a sign that reads: 

> Show up for the work. 

This is inspiration taken from the life of Christian author Rachel Held Evans, who sadly passed away in her late 30s. Her legacy lives on, in terms of inviting us to think seriously about what we believe and be open to changing our minds. She had a sign hanging above her writing desk that said those same words, representative of her vulnerability in spending time and being in relationship with people who thought differently than she did about important issues in the world. 

You are also likely to notice that I enjoy laughing and having fun. As Christopher P. Long says:

> Joy is at the heart of all meaningful work.

My hope is that we'll take our character seriously and the call to love our neighbors, while not taking ourselves too seriously (leaving room for growth and humility). May I be a person who models that right along with each of you. May you take the radical step of deciding each week that you're going to show up for the work in this class. If we do that together, it's quite possible we could leave changed people. 

![Image of a stop sign with a lizard sitting on top of it](https://innovatelearning.s3.amazonaws.com/jose-aragones-81QkOoPGahY-unsplash.jpg)

Go back to your Google slides now and continue there, until such point as it invites you back over for the next part. 

### 00.02 | How this class works

Speaking of showing up for the work, that's something that's important for you to do in this class. Yet, the act of showing up might look quite different, depending on your unique context and preferences. This isn't an easy class (at least that's what I've been told), but it is one that provides radical flexibility, in terms of how and when you can show up. 

#### The space-time continuum: Synchronous and asynchronous attendance

Ok. Not really. I'm not actually going to be teaching anything about the space-time continuum in this course. If you're interested in that topic, you're going to want to take a different class. Or, [watch a video with Neil deGrasse Tyson explaining it a gazillion times better than I'll ever do](https://youtu.be/SJhovNXqH6A?si=cvVoZmYg39ja3BR7). 

However, I do want to share how this class works, in terms of the 'time' that class is held each week. In a normal class, you walk into a classroom and the professor 'marks' you as present. Sometimes there are points associated with you entering the room (and staying there). Sometimes, you have more autonomy for determining when it makes sense for you to attend. 

In our class, we have Zoom sessions, which are somewhat like a normal class, in that they have a start time and an end time. However, there's also an option for you to not participate in those, but to otherwise demonstrate your having 'shown up' for class that week. 

On Canvas, you will see calendar entries most weeks called #connect, which reflect the times most of us will gather at the set time. During that time, we will often spend the time focused on  a portion of the lesson for that week (or occasionally part of a challenge). 

Higher education policies require that we have something that approximates attendance in a normal class, so if you come to the Zoom session, I'll mark you as "S" which stands for synchronous (meaning you attended using the scheduled time option). If you aren't at the Zoom, but you share your lesson for the week by the deadline, I'll mark you as "A" ~ which stands for asynchronous (meaning you opted to do the asynchronous option that week). I'm getting ahead of myself, though. More on this later on. 

#### Your story and our stories matter

Vanguard has used the Your Story Matters tagline for quite some time. Some people find it to be trite, but I've always really liked it. I suppose how you feel about it may depend on how sincere you believe someone to be when they say that to you. 

> Your story matters to me. 

I started teaching at Vanguard in 2004. You can imagine that I've met a lot of students in that time. To this day, I always get excited and nervous about a new class starting. As weird as this may sound, you matter to me, even though in some cases, we may not have ever met, yet. I am looking forward to getting to know you throughout this class. 

Individual stories are compelling. Something powerful happens when groups form and create collective stories together. In this class, I'm looking forward to when we become an 'us.' 

We are going to need to work together to find ways of exploring topics together, while respecting and honoring each other in the process. It is highly likely that we will have different perspectives, making it that much more important to acknowledge and affirm [the imago dei](https://www.christianity.com/wiki/bible/image-of-god-meaning-imago-dei-in-the-bible.html) in each of us. 

#### It takes a village, or at least some reliable tools

My first job out of college was working for a computer training company. I used to teach technology classes to business professionals and would often fall asleep with a thick book next to me, back when people used to read books to learn how to use a software application. Even today, I love technology enough to mark on my calendar when any Apple Keynotes will be held, such as at their annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). Dave, my husband, and I used to consider it a 'romantic' date before we were married to sit and watch the latest keynote from WWDC back in the day. ðŸ˜‚

I continue to find technology fascinating and marvel at both its positive and negative contributions to society and in business contexts. In this class, there is an essential set of technology tools that you'll need to use, in order to be successful. 



| TOOL                   | DESCRIPTION                                                  | DIFFICULTY |
| ---------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :--------: |
| **Google docs/slides** | Throughout our class, you will be provided with a link to a document, which gets copied as a template inside of your Google account. Despite there being advances in what Microsoft 365 offers us, there's still nothing as fast and easy, as accessing a Google document and engaging with it on your own, or with others. |    Easy    |
| **Quizlet**            | One of the best study methods supported by research is known as retrieval practice, or the testing effect. And one of the best tools I know of to create and share digital flashcards to support that practice is Quizlet. From your computer or phone, you can login to Quizlet, join our class, and strengthen your learning via the shared flashcards. |    Easy    |
| **Instagram**          | Did you know that Instagram allows you to create a separate account from your main one? In this class, we will each keep an account where we can share the learning from our class, engage with each other and build community. |   Medium   |
| **Raindrop.io**        | A big part of our class is going to be sharing with each other what we are learning and how we see business ethics through our unique contexts and current events. We will therefore need a place to store our stuff that connects us with each other and back into Canvas. We are going to use a digital bookmark tool called Raindrop.io, which lets us save stuff in a shared bookmark list, but will also push what we're finding onto our Canvas course shell. |   Medium   |
| **Canvas Studio**      | Inside Canvas is a video creation and collection tool called Canvas Studio. When you're logged into Canvas from a computer, you can access the tool way over on the right hand side of your browser, in the same place you can view the calendar, dashboard, etc. This semester, we will be creating and sharing many videos and having everything in one place is going to be incredibly helpful for us all. |    Hard    |
|                        |                                                              |            |

#### Ten lessons and challenges

You will notice a pattern in this class. Throughout the semester, we will all: 

- Learn stuff - by watching videos, reading text, talking to each other and people we connect with as a class, wrestling with case studies, checking our understanding through games and quizzes **#seek**
- Do stuff - challenge ourselves to go beyond just learning something, but actually applying it in some way **#sense**
- Share stuff - the best kind of learning is the kind that is done in community with others **#share**

I know it is clichÃ©, but you will get out of this class what you put into it. While I recognize that each of you has busy schedules and plenty of other priorities, I expect that you will invest not just time into this course, but also that you'll challenge yourself to make this a good ROI (return on investment) for the time and money spent such that you can be a part of it. Do the right thing by investing in yourself and others this semester. 

> "Brothers and sisters, do not be weary in doing what is right."
>
> -- 2 Thessalonians 3:13

My commitment is the same right back to you. As you challenge yourself, I will be continuing to work to be effective at facilitating learning and helping us all to have fun and be compassionately challenged along the way. 

###### ? 00.02 | Review questions | How this class works

> Here are some review questions on how this class works. Test your understanding by answering them. 

What is the definition of synchronous attendance in this class?

[[ ]] Attending class via the alternative attendance options

[[ ]] An option for those who can't meet or prefer not to meet at the scheduled times

[[X]] Attending class during the scheduled time via Zoom

[[ ]] Informing Dr. B about your absence in advance



How is the class structured?

[[ ]] Around five lessons and five case studies

[[X]] Around ten lessons and ten challenges

[[ ]] Around ten lessons, five challenges, and three exams

[[ ]] Around a varied number of lessons and challenges
