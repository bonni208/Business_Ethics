# Business Ethics

I am so glad you're here. While I have taught this class well over ten times, this time feels different. In the Spring of 2024, I have decided to 'burn the class down to the ground' and rebuild it in a format inspired by some of the greatest teachers I have ever met. Also, each class is unique and I am so looking forward to us becoming an us in the coming weeks. 

> Watch the following video to get to know a few things about me, as well as discover a bit about our class. 

<iframe width="100%" height="580" allowfullscreen="true" allow="autoplay *" title="busn435-welcome-video-walk" src="https://vanguard.instructuremedia.com/embed/cba6c2a1-32b3-4a4f-b01e-6e14dd3a132c" frameborder="0"></iframe>

**Design**

This course is designed to be engaging, challenging, and practical, encouraging you to think deeply about your roles in shaping the ethical landscape of business. My hope is that you will 'show up' for it in the fullness of who you are and that together we will cultivate the kind of environment that is necessary for that kind of vulnerability to be possible. The is made up of ten lessons [^1] and ten challenges[^2]. Each lesson is designed to generate curiosity and help reinforce the relevance of the content. Each challenge provides opportunities to apply the learning in your unique context and to take time out for personal reflection. 

At certain parts of my life, I have felt stuck deciding on what seemed like two, binary choices. Like those old fashioned tv game shows where you had to pick door A or door B. 

![Game show in the style of 1950s with two doors as choices: A or B](https://innovatelearning.s3.amazonaws.com/game-show-choice.png)

Someone I worked with reminded me that there are hardly only just two options we might pick in our lives. The options are boundless. But, also, Henry Nouwen reminds us in the following quote that God is with us, through all the choices we make in our life and we can rest easy in that. 

> There is no such thing as the right place, the right job, the right calling or ministry. I can be happy or unhappy in all situations. I am sure of it, because I have been â€¦ deciding to do this, that, or the other for the next five, ten, or twenty years is no great decision. Turning fully, unconditionally, and without fear to God is. Yet this awareness sets me free.
>
> -- Henry J.M. Nouwen 

Thank you for taking the time out of your week to get started with Business Ethics (aka BUSN 435). 

![LEGO bricks - AI generated - university campus](https://innovatelearning.s3.amazonaws.com/busn435-lego-bricks-00-start.png)

*While not an actual LEGO set you can buy (nor am I quite that huge in real life), I'm looking forward to us being able to use our creativity together this semester to create something memorable. Not sold in stores. Not available in real life. Not Vanguard's actual campus. Not absent of bias.[^3] You get the idea...* 

[^1]: My inspiration for the synchronicity involved in having ten lessons and ten challenges comes from the incredible Mike Wesch. His [Anth101](https://anth101.com) cultural anthropology course site continues to stretch and expand my imagination, each time I visit it.
[^2]: As I think back to my college classes, the ones that I still draw from today, all these decades later, are the ones in which I was challenged in some way outside the normal class time. One professor who is particularly memorable at having done so was [Bernard McGrane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_McGrane). In his sociology classes, we would be asked to break a social norm in some way, like entering an elevator in a busy business complex and not immediately turn around and look at the direction that the door would open, when we reached our floor. Pretty much all my assignments were me writing about how I just couldn't allow myself to break out of the norm in the ways his assignments described. I rarely get into an elevator to this day (decades later) without thinking of him. 
[^3]: You probably figured this out, already, but I created that LEGO box image using artificial intelligence. Perhaps some of may have also noticed that none of the students depicted in the picture appear as if they are women. The first time I asked the bot to create an image of a female professor with blonde hair and glasses, the minifig of the professor was of a man (with a scruffy mustache and beard) with long, blonde hair.  We will be talking a lot about this in class, but bias exists all around us, and within us. And the more we can 'name' when it happens, the more we can seek to create a more just and equitable world. In the meantime, enjoy the LEGO box (with more to come throughout our class). 

## 00. Let's get it started 

![course header - lesson one](https://innovatelearning.s3.amazonaws.com/busn435-course-header-lesson-00-1.jpg)

Welcome to Business Ethics (BUSN435) at Vanguard University. Throughout your experience of taking ten lessons and then experiencing ten challenges, you will grapple with essential questions about living a life of character and remaining true to your faith within the context of business. My aim is to equip you with the tools and insights necessary to navigate the complex landscape of ethical decision-making in the business world while upholding the values and principles rooted in your beliefs. Through these experiences, I hope to empower you to become an ethical leader who inspires positive change and positively impacts your professional and personal spheres.

> As you progress through this lesson, be sure to watch the videos, read the text, and answer the review questions are you are presented with them. More information is available on Canvas about what's expected, along with due dates, etc. 

One thing you're going to find about me is that I love music. Almost 100% of the time, there's a soundtrack playing in my head. So, if someone says something like: "Let's get it started," my mind is going instantly to music. Like [this song by The Black Eyed Peas](https://youtu.be/IKqV7DB8Iwg?si=AQ-9V0Y4VTCRM0z5). 

> I know I just told you to be sure to watch all the videos. YOU CAN SKIP THIS ONE, because it is just a song. Unless you are really ready to get it started. ðŸ˜‚ðŸŽ¯ðŸŽ‰

Let's go. 

### 00.01 | Why take a business ethics class

Speaking of decisions, there are likely many reasons a person may decide to take a class about business ethics. 

**Requirement.** I often hear people say that they needed it to meet some requirement (whether that be for accounting majors to hit the number of units they need to eventually earn a CPA license someday, or for a business major who needs upper division business elective units). 

**Flexibility.** Sometimes students tell me that the flexibility of the course gave them the option to design their schedule to meet their needs (whether that be because they're an athlete and they can better navigate practice times and games, or because they have work during many of the weeks when most of us will be meeting on Zoom). 

**The professor.** Finally, some people say that they have had me for classes, previously, and that they're excited for another adventure together. I don't take that lightly, as it is truly a joy to get to learn with others and I'm glad you have decided to take another class with me. 

**You're not sure ~ yet.** It's also quite possible you don't know yet why you're taking this class. Perhaps as you put together your schedule, everything didn't fall into place like you had hoped it would. My encouragement to you is to consider this week all of your schedule and determine if there are any changes you want to make, as when I was in college, I didn't think as intentionally as I might have liked to do about all the possibilities. If this is you, I don't want you to think you're alone. 

Taking a business ethics class is crucial for people looking to better understand the ways in which decision making and our beliefs get challenged, tested, and refined in the workplace, as a consumer, or as a business owner. Especially for those who claim a Christian worldview, a class like this can help prepare future leaders to navigate the complex ethical challenges that arise in the business world. 

As Christians, we are called to love our neighbors, tell the truth, and seek to live our Godâ€™s love in the world. While you will see references to biblical principles such as the golden rule in this class, it is not intended to be a theology class. Instead, you will be invited to reflect on your values, which often will intersect with ones embedded throughout Christianity, broadly speaking. Recognizing that most of us will go on to work in professional contexts that require us to work with people who are different than us and who follow other faith traditions or belief systems, you're going to be asked to express your perspectives in such a way as to be understood by people who have diverse worldviews. 

> I sent an email out to those who were registered for the class a few weeks back, asking for you to reply to let me know why you're taking a class about business ethics. If you haven't done so, already, please email me and share your reasoning and what you hope to get out of the course. 

#### It's more important than sword fighting

When I first started working at Vanguard, I had my first teaching assistant (TA). His name was Brandon and he was about to graduate. To finish up his coursework, he needed units, but they could be in anything he wanted to take. I thought it was so cool that he got to take sword fighting[^1], even though he wasn't a theatre major and never set foot on the stage. The class would practice on the Heath lawn and sometimes I would catch glimpses of them out there, looking like they were having a blast. 

This may be controversial, but for most people (besides theatre majors), I'm going to go out on a limb and say that business ethics is more important than sword fighting. If you find this offensive, reach out to me. Let's talk. I'm open to being wrong on this one. Speaking of sword fighting, I don't think I can reference it without putting [a clip from of one of my favorite movies of all time: The Princess Bride](https://youtu.be/I73sP93-0xA?si=dRfer2WimjEO2f53). 

!?[The Princess Bride movie clip - My Name is Inigo Montoya (1987)](https://youtu.be/I73sP93-0xA?si=dRfer2WimjEO2f53)

I'm pretty sure that Brandon never got as good as those actors in The Princess Bride at stage combat while at Vanguard, but he sure did brighten my days and I'm glad to have known him. I should probably get back to why someone may want to take a class about business ethics. 

[^1]: I'm realizing now that the class was (maybe still is?) called stage combat. But sword fighting seems so much better that I'm going to leave the error in and just go with it. If you need some help with accepting mistakes, you've got to listen to David Wilcox signing [Leave It Like It Is](https://youtu.be/S7mkdHQX-NE?si=xpb8WTS0ZSUKR7NL). I love listening to it and being reminded not to take myself and my human foibles so seriously. 

#### You will have a guide for life

I realize that part about having a guide for life sounds pretty dramatic. But I truly believe that the more we understand about ethics, in general, and the context that most of us will spend a huge percentage of our lives (work), the more we will be able to bring more of God's love into the world. 

A definition seems in order right about now: 

> Business ethics are the principles that guide decision-making and are vital for transparency, inviting feedback, considering the impacts on employees, stakeholders, and society, and reflecting on past experiences. 

Most of us like to consider ourselves ethical people. However, without being aware of the contexts in which we may be faced with incredibly challenging decisions, ones for which there are not easy answers, we are likely to make a choice that may not align with our espoused values. Every year we seem to hear about a company involved in some sort of ethical scandal affecting workers, customers, society as a whole, or the environment. Watch [The Importance of Business Ethics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHrDUu4Rjtg) to explore this further. 

> The speaker in [The Importance of Business Ethics](https://youtu.be/pHrDUu4Rjtg?si=Wra8DhuTZi21FcfV) discusses the importance of ethical behavior in business and the consequences of unethical actions. The video presents scenarios illustrating ethical dilemmas, cites examples of unethical corporate behavior, and emphasizes the negative impacts of a lack of ethics in organizations. Discover the significance of adhering to protected values and how ethical behavior can lead to improved employee morale, productivity, and long-term profitability, while recognizing how unethical actions can harm a company's reputation and investor confidence.

###### ? 00.01 | Review questions | The Importance of Business Ethics

> Here are some questions to test your understanding from watching the video. 

Volkswagen is mentioned for lying about emissions in the video.

[[X]] True
[[ ]] False

According to the video, a company's relationship with investors has no impact on ethical standards.

[[ ]] True
[[X]] False

The video suggests that employees with strong commitment to ethical values are more likely to report unethical behavior.

[[X]] True
[[ ]] False

What does the video primarily discuss?

[[ ]] Benefits of coffee consumption
[[X]] Ethical dilemmas in business
[[ ]] The history of Starbucks
[[ ]] Employee loyalty

According to the video, what is the quickest way to lose trust with employees?

[[ ]] Demanding high ethical standards
[[X]] Lying to employees

[[ ]]  Conducting experiments

What did the individuals in Wagner's experiment receive $5 for?

[[ ]] Reporting ethical breaches
[[X]] Flipping tails four times
[[ ]]  Lying to their employers
[[ ]] Treating customers unethically

Ethical responsibilities extend to society by promoting sustainable practices and corporate social responsibility (CSR), which are increasingly expected by customers, employees, and investors. To customers, ethical responsibilities include avoiding misleading practices like greenwashing and false advertising. With innovations such as artificial intelligence and facial recognition technology, the number of ethical dilemmas in business is increasing. 

As new technologies emerge, their long-term impacts, both positive and negative, may not be apparent until they have been in use for some time, as seen with the effects of social media on children and teenagers[^1]. Ethical treatment of employees is also crucial, as fair practices contribute to a successful organizational culture, which can benefit the company economically and legally.

[^1]: There's a lot more nuance regarding social media's impact on youth. The [Pew Research Center has some key findings from 2023](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/04/24/teens-and-social-media-key-findings-from-pew-research-center-surveys/) to explore for more. 

#### You're joining someone who finds utter joy in teaching and learning

Since the age of five, I knew what I was going to do for a living. I would have my stuffed animals and dolls set carfully out in my room, approximating a classroom. My mom had bought me materials from a local educational store. I had the books that my 'students' could use, as well as the 'teachers' edition, used to guide me in my pedagogy. My bedroom door had a sign hung on it, which read: Room 208. The name I used was Miss. Monroe, a testiment to the power of the 1970s version of the tv show Charlie's Angels' characters in my life at the time. 

When I was in college, picking a major was easy. I majored in social sciences, meaning I got to pick three of my favorite subjects to focus on: psychology, sociology, and history. I was certain that I would graduate with a single subject waiver to teach high school classes and would earn my teaching credential during what would have been my fifth year in college. I did graduate on time with a bachelors degree in social sciences, but my adventures in teaching have taken me plenty of places, but never inside a high school classroom. 

> I have always wanted to teach. 

Fast forward to today. I teach as a professor of business and management at Vanguard. I'm also dean of teaching and learning, which gives  me opportunities to collaborate with other faculty to improve all of our teaching and support efforts that allow students to thrive in their learning. My passion is in continually becoming more effective facilitating learning for students. Iâ€™m also fortunate to get to coach faculty and support them in my dean role. 

![Bonni podcasting](https://innovatelearning.s3.amazonaws.com/bonni-podcasting.jpg)

Since June of 2014, I have been airing weekly podcast episodes of [Teaching in Higher Ed](https://teachinginhighered.com). I started podcasting upon the urging of my husband, Dave, who I had met while earning my MA degree in Organizational Leadership. He had started the [Coaching for Leaders](https://coachingforleaders.com) podcast three years prior to his nudging for me to launch one. Given how much I enjoy talking about teaching and learning, I'm grateful for the ways in which those hundreds of conversations have shaped me all these years. 

I've been married to Dave since April of 2005. It took us many years and lots of medical interventions, but our two kids came into the world and have been surprising and delighting us ever since. One of my favorite things about being a parent is how infectious our son's and daughter's collective curiosity can be. 

If you would like to learn more about me, I have a fairly active presence online, including: 

- [Teaching in Higher Ed](https://teachinginhighered.com/) - website with my weekly podcast episodes, rare blog posts, and speaking resources from when I'm invited to share at other universities or conferences about teaching and learning
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bonnistachowiak/) - professional connections and occasional reflection posts
- [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/bonni208) - personal connections and occasional pics of what I'm up to
- [BUSN435 Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/busn435/) - an opportunity for us to experience #OpenEducation, to the extent we are comfortable to do so ~ this account is for our class, specifically 

![BUSN435 Instagram account, displaying a few sample quotes and the profile for the account](https://innovatelearning.s3.amazonaws.com/2024-01-08_10-32-41.jpg)

#### If you show up for the work, you may just find your life transformed

![Dr. B holds a sign that reads: 'show up for the work'](https://innovatelearning.s3.amazonaws.com/BonniHeadshots2022-46.jpg)

Those social media profiles that include a cover image as part of what we are invited to set up, I often post a picture of me, sitting in my Vanguard office, holding a sign that reads: 

> Show up for the work. 

This is inspiration taken from the life of Christian author Rachel Held Evans, who sadly passed away in her late 30s. Her legacy lives on, in terms of inviting us to think seriously about what we believe and be open to changing our minds. She had a sign hanging above her writing desk that said those same words, representative of her vulnerability in spending time and being in relationship with people who thought differently than she did about important issues in the world. 

You are also likely to notice that I enjoy laughing and having fun. As Christopher P. Long says:

> Joy is at the heart of all meaningful work.

My hope is that we'll take our character seriously and the call to love our neighbors, while not taking ourselves too seriously (leaving room for growth and humility). May I be a person who models that right along with each of you. May you take the radical step of deciding each week that you're going to show up for the work in this class. If we do that together, it's quite possible we could leave changed people. 

![Image of a stop sign with a lizard sitting on top of it](https://innovatelearning.s3.amazonaws.com/jose-aragones-81QkOoPGahY-unsplash.jpg)

Go back to your Google slides now and continue there, until such point as it invites you back over for the next part. 

### 00.02 | How this class works

Speaking of showing up for the work, that's something that's important for you to do in this class. Yet, the act of showing up might look quite different, depending on your unique context and preferences. This isn't an easy class (at least that's what I've been told), but it is one that provides radical flexibility, in terms of how and when you can show up. 

#### The space-time continuum: Synchronous and asynchronous attendance

Ok. Not really. I'm not actually going to be teaching anything about the space-time continuum in this course. If you're interested in that topic, you're going to want to take a different class. Or, [watch a video with Neil deGrasse Tyson explaining it a gazillion times better than I'll ever do](https://youtu.be/SJhovNXqH6A?si=cvVoZmYg39ja3BR7). 

However, I do want to share how this class works, in terms of the 'time' that class is held each week. In a normal class, you walk into a classroom and the professor 'marks' you as present. Sometimes there are points associated with you entering the room (and staying there). Sometimes, you have more autonomy for determining when it makes sense for you to attend. 

In our class, we have Zoom sessions, which are somewhat like a normal class, in that they have a start time and an end time. However, there's also an option for you to not participate in those, but to otherwise demonstrate your having 'shown up' for class that week. 

On Canvas, you will see calendar entries most weeks called #connect, which reflect the times most of us will gather at the set time. During that time, we will often spend the time focused on  a portion of the lesson for that week (or occasionally part of a challenge). 

Higher education policies require that we have something that approximates attendance in a normal class, so if you come to the Zoom session, I'll mark you as "S" which stands for synchronous (meaning you attended using the scheduled time option). If you aren't at the Zoom, but you share your lesson for the week by the deadline, I'll mark you as "A" ~ which stands for asynchronous (meaning you opted to do the asynchronous option that week). I'm getting ahead of myself, though. More on this later on. 

#### Your story and our stories matter

Vanguard has used the Your Story Matters tagline for quite some time. Some people find it to be trite, but I've always really liked it. I suppose how you feel about it may depend on how sincere you believe someone to be when they say that to you. 

> Your story matters to me. 

I started teaching at Vanguard in 2004. You can imagine that I've met a lot of students in that time. To this day, I always get excited and nervous about a new class starting. As weird as this may sound, you matter to me, even though in some cases, we may not have ever met, yet. I am looking forward to getting to know you throughout this class. 

Individual stories are compelling. Something powerful happens when groups form and create collective stories together. In this class, I'm looking forward to when we become an 'us.' 

We are going to need to work together to find ways of exploring topics together, while respecting and honoring each other in the process. It is highly likely that we will have different perspectives, making it that much more important to acknowledge and affirm [the imago dei](https://www.christianity.com/wiki/bible/image-of-god-meaning-imago-dei-in-the-bible.html) in each of us. 

#### It takes a village, or at least some reliable tools

My first job out of college was working for a computer training company. I used to teach technology classes to business professionals and would often fall asleep with a thick book next to me, back when people used to read books to learn how to use a software application. Even today, I love technology enough to mark on my calendar when any Apple Keynotes will be held, such as at their annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). Dave, my husband, and I used to consider it a 'romantic' date before we were married to sit and watch the latest keynote from WWDC back in the day. ðŸ˜‚

I continue to find technology fascinating and marvel at both its positive and negative contributions to society and in business contexts. In this class, there is an essential set of technology tools that you'll need to use, in order to be successful. 



| TOOL                   | DESCRIPTION                                                  | DIFFICULTY |
| ---------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :--------: |
| **Google docs/slides** | Throughout our class, you will be provided with a link to a document, which gets copied as a template inside of your Google account. Despite there being advances in what Microsoft 365 offers us, there's still nothing as fast and easy, as accessing a Google document and engaging with it on your own, or with others. |    Easy    |
| **Quizlet**            | One of the best study methods supported by research is known as retrieval practice, or the testing effect. And one of the best tools I know of to create and share digital flashcards to support that practice is Quizlet. From your computer or phone, you can login to Quizlet, join our class, and strengthen your learning via the shared flashcards. |    Easy    |
| **Instagram**          | Did you know that Instagram allows you to create a separate account from your main one? In this class, we will each keep an account where we can share the learning from our class, engage with each other and build community. |   Medium   |
| **Raindrop.io**        | A big part of our class is going to be sharing with each other what we are learning and how we see business ethics through our unique contexts and current events. We will therefore need a place to store our stuff that connects us with each other and back into Canvas. We are going to use a digital bookmark tool called Raindrop.io, which lets us save stuff in a shared bookmark list, but will also push what we're finding onto our Canvas course shell. |   Medium   |
| **Canvas Studio**      | Inside Canvas is a video creation and collection tool called Canvas Studio. When you're logged into Canvas from a computer, you can access the tool way over on the right hand side of your browser, in the same place you can view the calendar, dashboard, etc. This semester, we will be creating and sharing many videos and having everything in one place is going to be incredibly helpful for us all. |    Hard    |
|                        |                                                              |            |

#### Ten lessons and challenges

You will notice a pattern in this class. Throughout the semester, we will all: 

- Learn stuff - by watching videos, reading text, talking to each other and people we connect with as a class, wrestling with case studies, checking our understanding through games and quizzes **#seek**
- Do stuff - challenge ourselves to go beyond just learning something, but actually applying it in some way **#sense**
- Share stuff - the best kind of learning is the kind that is done in community with others **#share**

I know it is clichÃ©, but you will get out of this class what you put into it. While I recognize that each of you has busy schedules and plenty of other priorities, I expect that you will invest not just time into this course, but also that you'll challenge yourself to make this a good ROI (return on investment) for the time and money spent such that you can be a part of it. Do the right thing by investing in yourself and others this semester. 

> "Brothers and sisters, do not be weary in doing what is right."
>
> -- 2 Thessalonians 3:13

My commitment is the same right back to you. As you challenge yourself, I will be continuing to work to be effective at facilitating learning and helping us all to have fun and be compassionately challenged along the way. 

###### ? 00.02 | Review questions | How this class works

> Here are some review questions on how this class works. Test your understanding by answering them. 



What is the definition of synchronous attendance in this class?

[[ ]] Attending class via the alternative attendance options
[[ ]] An option for those who can't meet or prefer not to meet at the scheduled times
[[X]] Attending class during the scheduled time via Zoom
[[ ]] Informing Dr. B about your absence in advance

How is the class structured?

[[ ]] Around five lessons and five case studies
[[X]] Around ten lessons and ten challenges
[[ ]] Around ten lessons, five challenges, and three exams
[[ ]] Around a varied number of lessons and challenges

You must attend the Zoom sessions each week.

[[ ]] True
[[X]] False

You are expected to let Dr. B know if you are going to miss class.

[[ ]] True
[[X]] False

See Canvas and the syllabus for more information about how the class is structured. I'm here, if you have any questions or are confused about how this all works. I know it is not the norm for most classes and may take some getting used to. I have heard overwhelmingly positive feedback about Flex-VU classes in the past and will commit to doing what I can to ensure that we have a good experience together this semester. 



## 01. It's all personal (or is it?)

![Lesson 01 graphic](https://innovatelearning.s3.amazonaws.com/busn435-course-header-lesson-01.jpg)

I'll admit to often feeling more nervous than normal when teaching this class. The topics we explore together tend to sometimes bump up against aspects of our identity such that it feels far beyond the normal way we might approach learning in some other classes. I want for us to take our commitment to being ethical people quite seriously, while not taking ourselves so seriously that we hinder the potential for growth. 

In terms of the importance of taking this class seriously, the following come to mind as crucial reasons to do so:

1. **Moral Integrity:** The study of ethics helps individuals and societies maintain moral integrity. It guides us in distinguishing right from wrong and encourages us to act in ways that align with our values and principles. This fosters trust, respect, and fairness in our interactions with others.

2. **Accountability:** Ethical principles provide a framework for holding individuals and institutions accountable for their actions. It ensures that those who engage in unethical behavior can be held responsible for their actions, leading to justice and fairness.

4. **Long-Term Success:** Ethical decision-making often leads to long-term success and sustainability. Businesses and organizations that prioritize ethics tend to build stronger reputations, attract loyal customers, and retain talented employees.

5. **Personal Growth:** Embracing ethics can lead to personal growth and development. It encourages self-reflection and self-improvement, helping individuals become more empathetic, compassionate, and considerate of others.

On the other hand, not taking ourselves too seriously is also important for several reasons:

1. **Humility:** Recognizing our own limitations and imperfections fosters humility. It allows us to learn from our mistakes and be open to different perspectives and ideas.

2. **Reduced Stress:** Taking ourselves too seriously can lead to excessive stress and anxiety. It's important to be able to laugh at ourselves and not let small setbacks or failures define our self-worth.

3. **Improved Relationships:** People are often drawn to those who have a sense of humor and can take things lightly. It can enhance our social connections and make us more approachable.

4. **Adaptability:** Being flexible and adaptable is easier when we don't take ourselves too seriously. We can better cope with change and unexpected challenges.

5. **Creativity:** A more relaxed attitude can promote creativity and innovation. When we're not overly focused on perfection, we may be more willing to take risks and explore new ideas.

Taking ethics seriously helps us maintain our moral compass, while not taking ourselves too seriously can lead to personal growth, reduced stress, and improved relationships. Balancing these two aspects is essential for leading a meaningful and fulfilling life. It is also a way we can experience greater growth throughout our time together.

### 01.00 | What does it mean to be ethical?

What does it mean to be ethical, especially in business? It's more than just knowing right from wrong; it's about understanding how our decisions impact others. I will be making many references to the show The Good Place in this class. While not set in a business context, The Good Place still offers us many lessons to draw from in business ethics. I won't ruin the ending for you, but will introduce some characters and plot points along the way. 

> "The Good Place" is a television show that originally aired from 2016 to 2020. It was created by Michael Schur and features a unique blend of comedy, philosophy, and ethics. The show revolves around Eleanor Shellstrop, played by Kristen Bell, who wakes up in the afterlife and is told she has entered "The Good Place" due to her good deeds on Earth. However, Eleanor soon realizes that there has been a mistake, as she was not a virtuous person during her life. She teams up with other residents of The Good Place, including Chidi Anagonye (William Jackson Harper), Tahani Al-Jamil (Jameela Jamil), and Jason Mendoza (Manny Jacinto), to try and become a better person and earn her place in this supposed paradise.

In this first clip, we are going to hear about how points get assigned in the good place. Throughout each person's life, they earn and lose points with each good and bad choice. There is a brief mention of suicide in this clip.

You will continue to see clips show up from The Good Place in this course. It is a thought-provoking show that raises important ethical and philosophical questions. Its relevance to us in a business ethics course lies in its ability to spark discussions, illustrate ethical concepts, and provide valuable insights into moral decision-making, accountability, and personal growth, all of which are crucial aspects of ethical behavior in the business world. Besides, it is really funny and most students I meet appreciate humor being incorporated into classes versus more dry material.

#### It's more than just knowing right from wrong 

In answering the question of what it means to be ethical, it's more than just distinguishing right from wrong. It involves navigating a complex landscape filled with shades of grey and moral ambiguity. It's also about understanding how our decisions impact others. Here are several reasons why business ethics goes beyond a simplistic binary understanding of right and wrong: 

1. **Cultural and Contextual Differences**: What may be considered ethically acceptable in one culture or context may not be viewed the same way in another. Business ethics must take into account cultural relativism and contextual nuances. What's morally right in one situation could be morally questionable in another.

2. **Ethical Dilemmas**: Many business decisions involve ethical dilemmas where there are competing moral principles or values. For example, a company may need to decide between maximizing profits and ensuring the well-being of its employees. These situations require careful consideration of trade-offs and balancing conflicting interests.

3. **Subjectivity**: Ethical judgments often involve subjective elements. People may have differing opinions on what is morally right or wrong based on their personal beliefs, values, and experiences. This subjectivity can make it challenging to arrive at a universally accepted ethical framework.

4. **Legal vs. Ethical**: Something may be legal but still unethical, or it may be ethical but illegal. Legal frameworks provide a minimum standard of behavior, but they do not encompass all ethical considerations. Business ethics extends beyond compliance with laws and regulations.

5. **Ethical Grey Areas**: In some cases, there may be ethical grey areas where it's difficult to determine what the right course of action is. These situations require critical thinking, ethical reasoning, and a consideration of potential consequences.

6. **Conflicting Stakeholder Interests**: Businesses have multiple stakeholders with competing interests, including shareholders, employees, customers, suppliers, and the community. Balancing these interests ethically can be challenging, as decisions may impact some stakeholders positively and others negatively.

7. **Ethical Risk Management**: Business ethics also involves managing ethical risks and potential conflicts of interest. Companies must implement policies and procedures to identify, mitigate, and prevent unethical behavior within their organization.

8. **Evolving Ethical Standards**: Ethical standards can change over time as societal values evolve. What was considered ethically acceptable in the past may be viewed as unethical today. Businesses must stay attuned to these changing ethical norms and adapt their practices accordingly.

9. **Gray Areas in Business Practices**: Some business practices, such as marketing tactics, pricing strategies, and competitive behavior, can operate in ethical grey areas. Decisions about how to engage in these practices ethically can be complex and nuanced.

10. **Moral Dilemmas in Leadership**: Leaders often face moral dilemmas where they must choose between conflicting values, such as honesty and loyalty. Ethical leadership involves making difficult decisions with integrity and transparency.

Let's look at an example in a fictional story, but one that is relatable in a real world context. In the movie Zootopia, Judy Hopps (a rabbit police officer) is trying to solve a missing mammals case. During a press conference, she makes an unintentionally insensitive comment about predators. Nick Wilde, a fox and her unlikely partner, takes offense and confronts her about it.

This scene demonstrates how business ethics can move beyond simply right or wrong. Misunderstandings can so easily arise, even with good intentions. While this story is fictional, these kinds of misunderstandings and opportunities for our biases to negatively impact us our relationships happen all the time in a business context. 

Business ethics is a multidimensional field that requires individuals and organizations to navigate complex ethical terrain. It involves considering diverse perspectives, weighing competing values, and making principled decisions that align with one's values and the expectations of society. Recognizing the presence of grey areas in business ethics underscores the need for critical thinking, ethical reasoning, and continuous reflection on ethical principles in the corporate world.
